Effective early prediction mechanisms are critical for minimizing these impacts. In our previous work, we developed a smart and secure wireless sensor network (WSN) utilizing physical sensors to emulate forest fire dynamics and predict fire scenarios using machine learning. Building on this foundation, this study explores the integration of virtual sensors to enhance the prediction capabilities of the WSN. Virtual sensors were generated using polynomial regression models and incorporated into a supervector framework, effectively augmenting the data from physical sensors. The enhanced dataset was used to train a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) to classify multiple fire scenarios, covering both early warning and advanced fire states. Our experimental results demonstrate that the addition of virtual sensors significantly improves the accuracy of fire scenario predictions, especially in complex situations like “Fire with Thundering” and “Fire with Thundering and Lightning”. The extended model’s ability to predict early warning scenarios such as lightning and smoke is particularly promising for proactive fire management strategies. This paper highlights the potential of combining physical and virtual sensors in WSNs to achieve superior prediction accuracy and scalability of the field without any extra cost. Such findings pave the way for deploying scalable (cost-effective), intelligent monitoring systems capable of addressing the growing challenges of forest fire prevention and management. We obtained significant results in specific scenarios based on the number of virtual sensors added, while in some scenarios, the results were less promising compared to using only physical sensors. However, the integration of virtual sensors enables coverage of much larger areas, making it a highly promising approach despite these variations. Future work includes further optimization of the virtual sensor generation process and expanding the system’s capability to handle large-scale forest environments. Moreover, utilizing virtual sensors will alleviate many challenges associated with the huge number of deployed physical sensors. © 2025 by the authors.",data augmentation; early warning systems; environmental monitoring; fire scenario classification; forest fire prediction; machine learning; smart sensing systems; supervector formation; virtual sensors; wireless sensor networks (WSN),,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215950831,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of forest fires in South Korea are caused by humans. Over the past decade, more than half of these types of fires occurred during the spring season. Although human activities are the primary cause of forest fires, the fact that they are concentrated in the spring underscores the strong association between forest fires and meteorological factors. When meteorological conditions favor the occurrence of forest fires, certain triggering factors can lead to their ignition more easily. The purpose of this study is to analyze the meteorological factors influencing forest fires and to develop a machine learning-based prediction model for forest fire occurrence, focusing on meteorological data. The study focuses on four regions within Gangwon province in South Korea, which have experienced substantial damage from forest fires. To construct the model, historical meteorological data were collected, surrogate variables were calculated, and a variable selection process was applied to identify relevant meteorological factors. Five machine learning models were then used to predict forest fire occurrence and ensemble techniques were employed to enhance the model’s performance. The performance of the developed forest fire prediction model was evaluated using evaluation metrics. The results indicate that the ensemble model outperformed the individual models, with a higher F1-score and a notable reduction in false positives compared to the individual models. This suggests that the model developed in this study, when combined with meteorological forecast data, can potentially predict forest fire occurrence and provide insights into the expected severity of fires. This information could support decision-making for forest fire management, aiding in the development of more effective fire response plans. © 2024 by the authors.",forest fire; machine learning; meteorological factor; multi-model ensemble,Damage; Data; Decision Making; Forest Fires; Korea; Models; Performance; South Korea; Decision making; Fire hazards; Forest ecology; Information management; Premixed flames; Weather forecasting; Fire occurrences; Fire prediction models; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Meteorological data; Meteorological factors; Multi-model ensemble; Performance; South Korea; climate conditions; climate effect; forest fire; machine learning; spring (season); Prediction models,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210283809,Forests,"AI for Climate & Disaster Management Center, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea; Department of Urban and Environmental and Disaster Management, Graduate School of Disaster Prevention, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea; Department of Artificial Intelligence & Software, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea; Department of Artificial Intelligence & Software, Graduate School of Disaster Prevention, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea","Choi S., AI for Climate & Disaster Management Center, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea; Son M., Department of Urban and Environmental and Disaster Management, Graduate School of Disaster Prevention, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea; Kim C., Department of Artificial Intelligence & Software, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea; Kim B., Department of Artificial Intelligence & Software, Graduate School of Disaster Prevention, Kangwon National University, Samcheok, 25913, South Korea",,,,,,,"C.

JULES-INFERNO is a global vegetation and fire model simulating wildfire emissions and area burnt on a global scale. However, because of the high data dimensionality and system complexity, JULES-INFERNO's computational costs make it challenging to apply to fire risk forecasting with unseen initial conditions. Typically, running JULES-INFERNO for 30 years of prediction will take several hours on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. To tackle this bottleneck, two data-driven models are built in this work based on Deep Learning techniques to surrogate the JULES-INFERNO model and speed up global wildfire forecasting. More precisely, these machine learning models take global temperature, vegetation density, soil moisture and previous forecasts as inputs to predict the subsequent global area burnt on an iterative basis. Average Error per Pixel (AEP) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed surrogate models. A fine tuning strategy is also proposed in this work to improve the algorithm performance for unseen scenarios. Numerical results show a strong performance of the proposed models, in terms of both computational efficiency (less than 20 seconds for 30 years of prediction on a laptop CPU) and prediction accuracy (with AEP under 0.3% and SSIM over 98% compared to the outputs of JULES-INFERNO). © 2017 IEEE.",ConvLSTM; machine learning; surrogate modelling; wildfire,Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Deep learning; Digital elevation model; Laptop computers; Prediction models; Soil moisture; Average errors; ConvLSTM; Global scale; Machine-learning; Performance; Similarity indices; Structural similarity; Surrogate modeling; Wildfire; Wildfire modeling; Premixed flames,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216779857,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complex interactions among fuels, topography, and meteorological factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind, govern wildfire ignition and spread. This research presents a framework that integrates satellite remote sensing and numerical weather prediction model data to refine estimations of final wildfire sizes. A key strength of our approach is the use of comprehensive geospatial datasets from the IBM PAIRS platform, which provides a robust foundation for our predictions. We implement machine learning techniques through the AutoGluon automated machine learning toolkit to determine the optimal model for burned area prediction. AutoGluon automates the process of feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, evaluating a diverse range of algorithms, including neural networks, gradient boosting, and ensemble methods, to identify the most effective predictor for wildfire area estimation. The system features an intuitive interface developed in Gradio, which allows the incorporation of key input parameters, such as vegetation indices and weather variables, to customize wildfire projections. Interactive Plotly visualizations categorize the predicted fire severity levels across regions. This study demonstrates the value of synergizing Earth observations from spaceborne instruments and forecast data from numerical models to strengthen real-time wildfire monitoring and postfire impact assessment capabilities for improved disaster management. We optimize an ensemble model by comparing various algorithms to minimize the root mean squared error between the predicted and actual burned areas, achieving improved predictive performance over any individual model.

Wildfires not only cause direct damage to human life and property but also lead to complex environmental issues, including forest ecosystem destruction and acceleration of climate change through massive greenhouse gas emissions. In South Korea, where forests cover 70% of the territory, accurate assessment and effective management of wildfire damage have emerged as critical challenges. Notably, 99.5% of domestic wildfires are small to medium fires under 100 ha, and their cumulative impact on forest ecosystems is substantial. Traditional burn severity assessment methods based on spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized burn ratio (NBR) have limitations in providing consistent evaluation criteria, as appropriate thresholds vary depending on forest types and regional characteristics. Therefore, this study developed a Transformer-based semantic segmentation model to classify burn severity into three levels: surface fire, crown scorch, and crown fire. To mitigate the class imbalance issues, we conducted experiments with three different sampling approaches for the unburned class, achieving a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.748 with the final model. Notably, the model demonstrated its practical applicability by achieving over 90% prediction accuracy in validating small wildfires under 1ha. This study presents a novel methodology for rapid and accurate estimation of burn severity using deep learning-based segmentation. It is expected to provide a foundation for establishing burn severity assessment systems and effective forest restoration planning tailored to South Korea’s forest characteristics.

Forest fires alter forest structure and composition; threaten people's livelihoods; and lead to economic losses, as well as soil erosion and desertification. Climate change and related drought events, paired with anthropogenic activities, have magnified the intensity and frequency of forest fires. Consequently, we analysed forest fire susceptibility (FFS), which can be understood as the likelihood of fire occurrence in a certain area. We applied a random forest (RF) machine learning (ML) algorithm to model current and future FFS in the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany) using topographic, climatic, anthropogenic, soil, and vegetation predictors. FFS was modelled at a spatial resolution of 50m for current (2014-2022) and future scenarios (2081-2100). Model accuracy ranged between 69% (RFtest) and 71% (leave one year out, LOYO), showing a moderately high model reliability for predicting FFS. The model results underscore the importance of anthropogenic parameters and vegetation parameters in modelling FFS on a regional level. This study will allow forest managers and environmental planners to identify areas which are most susceptible to forest fires, enhancing warning systems and prevention measures. © Author(s) 2025.",,Brandenburg [Germany]; Germany; algorithm; climate change; desertification; drought; fire management; forest fire; human activity; land use change; machine learning; prediction; soil erosion; spatial resolution; topography; vegetation,Copernicus Publications,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216424835,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study employs the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to analyze the confidence levels of hotspots, aiming to predict potential fire occurrences and improve fire management strategies. The research focuses on peatlands spanning 3.86 million ha, using key variables such as NDVI, surface temperature, and peat thickness derived from satellite data. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.732 and a classification accuracy of 70.3%, with medium-confidence hotspots demonstrating the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.707, F1-score: 0.804). However, the model struggled with low-confidence hotspots, reflecting challenges in distinguishing less prominent patterns in the data. Compared to other methods, RF demonstrates strong potential in handling complex environmental datasets, making it a valuable tool for hotspot prediction.

However, recent shifts in wildfire frequency, intensity, and seasonality pose unprecedented challenges for fire management in Alaska's remote and ecologically vulnerable regions. This study addresses the challenge of wildfire occurrence and behavior prediction in Alaska by developing a comprehensive framework that leverages satellite-based data, geospatial features, advanced optimization, and machine learning (ML). First, NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) dataset spanning +20 years is processed using a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to create refined wildfire datasets. A sequential Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed for cost-effective feature selection from 49 geospatial features, including remote sensing and reanalysis data. Histogram Gradient Boosting (HistGB) is then used for predictive modeling of wildfire occurrence, burnt area, and wildfire duration. This ensemble model's performance is benchmarked across four prediction horizons (same-day, +7 days, +30 days, +90 days) and against various conventional ML and deep learning techniques. Results highlight key factors influencing wildfire dynamics in Alaska and demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy (e.g., an average improvement of 72.62% in wildfire occurrence accuracy regardless of prediction horizon), offering valuable insights for risk assessment and resource allocation in wildfire management in Alaska. © 2024 The Authors",Alaska; Deep learning; Feature selection; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Permafrost lanscape; Wildfires,Alaska; United States; cluster analysis; genetic algorithm; machine learning; model validation; permafrost; remote sensing; resource allocation; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214340854,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilizing advanced remote sensing, geospatial information system (GIS) processing techniques such as cloud computing, and machine learning algorithms, this research analyzed the impact of climatic parameters, topographic features, and human-related factors on wildfire susceptibility assessment and prediction in Iran. Multiple scenarios were developed for this purpose based on the data sampling strategy. The findings revealed that climatic elements such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity significantly contribute to wildfire susceptibility, while human activities—particularly population density and proximity to powerlines—also played a crucial role. Furthermore, the seasonal impact of each parameter was separately assessed during warm and cold seasons. The results indicated that human-related factors, rather than climatic variables, had a more prominent influence during the seasonal analyses. This research provided new insights into wildfire dynamics in Iran by generating high-resolution wildfire susceptibility maps using advanced machine learning classifiers. The generated maps identified high-risk areas, particularly in the central Zagros region, the northeastern Hyrcanian Forest, and the northern Arasbaran forest, highlighting the urgent need for effective fire management strategies. © 2025 The Authors",Climate; Cloud computing; Google earth engine; Human activity; Machine learning; Overpass Turbo; Remote sensing; Wildfire,Iran; anthropogenic source; assessment method; climate change; GIS; machine learning; parameter estimation; remote sensing; seasonal variation,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215085275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a small scale, it is possible to ensure constant monitoring of the natural landscape through ground means. However, on the scale of large countries, this becomes practically impossible due to remote and vast forest territories. The most promising source of data in this case that can provide global monitoring is remote sensing data. Currently, the main challenge is the development of an effective pipeline that combines geospatial data collection and the application of advanced machine learning algorithms. Most approaches focus on short-term fire spreading prediction and utilize data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for this purpose. In this study, we address the challenge of predicting fire spread on a large scale and consider a forecasting horizon ranging from 1 to 5 days. We train a neural network model based on the MA-Net architecture to predict wildfire spread based on environmental and climate data, taking into account spatial distribution features. Estimating the importance of features is another critical issue in fire behavior prediction, so we analyze their contribution to the model’s results. According to the experimental results, the most significant features are wind direction and land cover parameters. The F1-score for the predicted burned area varies from 0.64 to 0.68 depending on the day of prediction (from 1 to 5 days). The study was conducted in northern Russian regions and shows promise for further transfer and adaptation to other regions. This geospatial data-based artificial intelligence (AI) approach can be beneficial for supporting emergency systems and facilitating rapid decision-making. © 2024, The Author(s).",,article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; burn patient; deep neural network; drug therapy; fire; forecasting; forest; human; land use; learning algorithm; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; unmanned aerial vehicle; wildfire; wind,Nature Research,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183818604,Sci.

This has led to extensive damage to natural resources, including forests and wildlife habitats. Effective management strategies are essential to mitigate these impacts, and this study aims to contribute to that effort through spatial prediction of forest fires in India using machine learning techniques. The research begins by analyzing spatial patterns and trends of forest fires and identifying key factors contributing to their occurrence. It then explores the relationships between forest fires and these factors. Using data from 2001 to 2020, the study develops a probability map of forest fire occurrences in India, leveraging data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on fire points and burned areas and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) land use land cover. The analysis incorporates various fire occurrence conditioning factors, including climate variables (precipitation, air temperature, specific humidity, near-surface wind speed, net longwave radiation, and land surface temperature for both daytime and nighttime), biophysical factors (aspect, slope, elevation, soil moisture, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and other factors such as proximity to railways, roads, and waterways. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) was employed to identify these factors and generate the probability map. The results indicate that forest fires are predominantly concentrated in three major regions: Northeast India, Uttarakhand-Himachal, and the Deccan Plateau. The study also highlights the link between forest fires and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, and 15). The findings can inform the identification of vulnerable areas, enabling the implementation of preventative measures. This research is crucial as it not only pinpoints regions at risk of forest fires but also elucidates their impacts on the environment and local livelihoods, thereby enhancing risk assessment and early warning systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",Biophysical factors; Environmental threat; MaxEnt model; Probability mapping; Spatial analysis; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; India; Machine Learning; Risk Assessment; Wildfires; Deccan; India; Uttarakhand; Fire hazards; Risk assessment; Soil moisture; Biophysical factors; Environmental threats; Forest fires; Maximum entropy model model; Maximum entropy models; Probability mapping; Risks assessments; Spatial analysis; Spatial prediction; Sustainable development goal; climate change; early warning system; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental modeling; forest fire; land use change; machine learning; mapping method; MODIS; prediction; probability; risk assessment; spatial analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; ecosystem; fire; forest; India; machine learning; risk assessment; wildfire; Forest ecology,Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217162851,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite ongoing prevention efforts, large-scale fires continue to devastate vast areas of forest and agricultural land, a situation exacerbated by climate change and human activities. Proactive approaches are essential to mitigate this phenomenon, requiring reliable and robust susceptibility models. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of wildfire susceptibility models by incorporating a temporal perspective into the assessment of machine learning models. Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on spatial validation, this research integrates temporal analysis to assess the accuracy of future predictions. Focusing on the province of Jijel, Algeria, the study employs six well established machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting (HGB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression (LR)—to assess the wildfire exposure. The findings reveal that temporal sampling in wildfire susceptibility models decreases performance by 2–20% compared to spatial sampling, indicating the significant influence of temporal aspect on model reliability and overestimation due to data partitioning based solely on spatial sampling. Additionally, the study highlights a trade-off between performance and reliability: while HGB emerges as the best-performing model, its reliability is relatively low. In contrast, LR, despite being the least performant model, demonstrates the highest reliability and consistency across both spatial and temporal evaluations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Forest fire; Jijel Algeria; Machine learning; Remote sensing data; Temporal sampling; Wildfire susceptibility mapping,Algeria; Jijel; climate change; hazard assessment; machine learning; remote sensing; study perspective; temporal analysis; wildfire,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211444278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The continuing climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfire, resulting in urgent needs in searching for better fire management strategies. This paper aims to pave a pathway towards meeting this challenge through accurately predicting spatiotemporal pattern of global wildfire risk, using an improved Transformer model that integrates information theory and full-attention mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimAM modulated Full Attention Network shows superior performances in terms of Accuracy, Recall, and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve. Furthermore, new discoveries based on the model find out that the wildfire risk in the northern forest region of Australia is influenced by the seasonality of the climate in North America and the Pacific and the dry winter climate in the Canadian region, illuminating the intricate relationship between the global climate and regional wildfire risk. These findings provide new tools and knowledges for understanding the mechanisms in global wildfire risk. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Deep learning; SimAM modulated full attention network (SimFAN); Transformer; Wildfire mechanism; Wildfire prediction,Australia; accuracy assessment; climate change; experimental study; precision; prediction; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211193241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, there is a need for reliable and operational methods to monitor and map these disturbances for the development of suitable management strategies. While susceptibility assessment using machine learning methods has increased, most studies have focused on a single disturbance. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of the use of “Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)” in the literature. In this study, susceptibility assessment for multiple forest disturbances (fires, insect damage, and wind damage) was conducted using the PyCaret AutoML framework in the Izmir Regional Forest Directorate (RFD) in Turkey. The AutoML framework compared 14 machine learning algorithms and ranked the best models based on AUC (area under the curve) values. The extra tree classifier (ET) algorithm was selected for modeling the susceptibility of each disturbance due to its good performance (AUC values > 0.98). The study evaluated susceptibilities for both individual and multiple disturbances, creating a total of four susceptibility maps using fifteen driving factors in the assessment. According to the results, 82.5% of forested areas in the Izmir RFD are susceptible to multiple disturbances at high and very high levels. Additionally, a potential forest disturbances map was created, revealing that 15.6% of forested areas in the Izmir RFD may experience no damage from the disturbances considered, while 54.2% could face damage from all three disturbances. The SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) methodology was applied to evaluate the importance of features on prediction and the nonlinear relationship between explanatory features and susceptibility to disturbance. © The Author(s) 2024.",AutoML; Forest disturbances; Forest fire; Insect; Susceptibility; Wind,Izmir [Turkey]; Turkey; Climate change; Damage detection; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fire hazards; Fires; Learning algorithms; Automated machine learning; Automated machines; Forest disturbances; Forest fires; Insect; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Regional forests; Susceptibility; Wind damage; algorithm; climate change; environmental assessment; environmental disturbance; forest ecosystem; insect; machine learning; Machine learning,Springer Nature,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189202592,J.

The increase in annual fire occurrence and the complexity of environmental factors affecting fire occurrence in the Zagros vegetation zone have increased the importance of modeling factors affecting fire occurrence in this region. Therefore, forecasting fire-prone areas and practical factors can help forest managers to prevent destructive fires. This study aims to modulate the fire-sensitive areas using machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and generalized linear model (GLM). Materials &Methods: Fire-effective factors were categorized into four classes (physiographic, biological, climatic, and anthropogenic factors) and 16 raster-based variables. The fire susceptibility maps were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) values extracted from the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. In addition, the RF model was used to determine the relative importance of each variable. Findings: Results showed that fires happened in the middle elevation (300-2000m), lower slopes (<20%), and in the west and southwest slope aspects. More fires were also in agricultural and residential areas. The validation of fire susceptibility maps showed that the RF model (AUC=0.911) has higher accuracy than the SVM (AUC=0.864) and GLM models (AUC=0.824). Based on the RF model, high and very high-risk had low areas (9.48 and 5.97%, respectively). The most effective factors on fire occurrence were anthropogenic (distance from residential, distance from agricultural lands, and distance from roads) and climatic factors (relative air humidity, wind speed, and slope aspect), and the least important factors were distance from rivers and slope aspect. Conclusion: Given the role of anthropogenic factors in the occurrence of fires, it is suggested that nature-based education be increased and people’s dependence on these forest ecosystems be reduced. Given the lack of sufficient information on fires and the importance of research on forest fires, it is recommended that a database of past and ongoing fires in the forests of the study area using remote sensing and geographic information systems and a history of fires in these areas be prepared to evaluate fire occurrence models in future research. © 2021, the Authors.",Generalized Linear Model; MODIS Fire Product; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine; Zagros,,Tarbiat Modares University,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000697013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most existing research on wildfire fields focuses primarily on wildfire identification and prediction, with limited attention given to the intelligent interpretation of detailed information, such as fire front within fire region. To address this gap, advance the analysis of fire front in UAV-captured visible images, and facilitate future calculations of fire behavior parameters, a new method is proposed for the intelligent segmentation and fire front interpretation of wildfire regions. This proposed method comprises three key steps: deep learning-based fire segmentation, boundary tracking of wildfire regions, and fire front interpretation. Specifically, the YOLOv7-tiny model is enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which integrates channel and spatial attention mechanisms to improve the model's focus on wildfire regions and boost the segmentation precision. Experimental results show that the proposed method improved detection and segmentation precision by 3.8 % and 3.6 %, respectively, compared to existing approaches, and achieved an average segmentation frame rate of 64.72 Hz, which is well above the 30 Hz threshold required for real-time fire segmentation. Furthermore, the method's effectiveness in boundary tracking and fire front interpreting was validated using an outdoor grassland fire fusion experiment's real fire image data. Additional tests were conducted in southern New South Wales, Australia, using data that confirmed the robustness of the method in accurately interpreting the fire front. The findings of this research have potential applications in dynamic data-driven forest fire spread modeling and fire digital twinning areas.

This research aims to identify and analyze the factors influencing forest fires in Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Papua during the rainy, dry and all-season conditions using machine learning techniques and create vulnerability prediction maps and categorize risk zones. Eight years (2015–2022) of forest fire data were combined with 15 forest fire susceptible factors that consider of human, environmental, meteorological, and land use/land cover conditioning factors. Random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models were used to train and validate the dataset through hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation for accuracy assessment. The XGB model was selected as the best performer based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score and was used to generate probability values. The evaluation showed that the accuracies and AUC values for the nine models were greater than 0.7, with AUC values ranging from 0.71 to 0.95, indicating good performance. Papua had the highest accuracy, with 90.5%, 91.6%, and 92.5% for all, rainy, and dry seasons, respectively. Population density, elevation, precipitation, soil moisture, NDMI, NDVI, distance from roads and settlements, land surface temperature and peatlands are the key contributing factors of forest fire occurrences. Vulnerability maps categorized into five risk zones, identifying high-risk areas that aligned with observed fire occurrences. This research highlighted the diverse characteristics of factors that determine forest fires and examined their impact on fire occurrences. The findings provide actionable insights for targeted fire management strategies, though future research should incorporate additional variables to improve predictive accuracy and address long-term environmental changes. © 2025 The Authors",Machine learning; Partial dependence plot; Prediction; Remote sensing; Wildfire susceptibility mapping,Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Papua [(PRV) Indonesia]; forest fire; machine learning; mapping; prediction; remote sensing; seasonal variation; vulnerability,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218857752,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many forecasting techniques predict fire activity and allocate prevention resources, but various factors are missing from the assessments, and multi-criteria decision approaches alone are insufficient. This work introduced a novel methodology combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP multi-criteria methods, and spatial data to detect potential forest fire vulnerability areas using twenty variables. The results from AHP or fuzzy AHP, were processed using a multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation algorithm. The final ANN model has two objectives: first, to create a forest fire vulnerability with four classes (low, moderate, high, and very high), and second, to classify burned area sizes in regions highly or very highly vulnerable to fire. Evaluation metrics were also applied for validation. The fire model was tested using both literature review data and in situ observations. Comparative analysis showed that the burned area size model performed better than other machine learning methods, achieving an accuracy score of 89%. Meanwhile, the fire vulnerability model scored 82%. The study addresses the problem of prediction and provides an algorithm for classifying fire risk based on historical data in the Czech Republic, offering a master model for future forest management. Therefore, the ANN model, once trained, validated, and tested, does not require resetting and is effective for estimating forest fire vulnerability. Moreover, it produces results quickly, providing rapid insights into complex forest ecosystems, saving time and enhancing understanding for decision-makers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Analytical hierarchy process/fuzzy decision analysis; Artificial neural network process; Burned area size; Forest fire vulnerability model; Geographical information system; Multilayer perceptron classification,Multilayer neural networks; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Analytical hierarchy process/fuzzy decision analyze; Artificial neural network process; Burned area size; Burned areas; Forest fire vulnerability model; Forest fires; Fuzzy decision analysis; Geographical information; Geographical information system; Multilayer perceptron classification; Multilayers perceptrons; Network process; Neural-networks; Vulnerability models; Premixed flames,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205728193,Eng Appl Artif Intell,"Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Hassan II University of Casablanca, Faculty of sciences Ben M'Sick, Avenue Cdt, Driss Al Harti - Ben M'Sick, Casablanca, Casablanca, B.P 7955, Morocco","Tahri M., Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Badr S., Hassan II University of Casablanca, Faculty of sciences Ben M'Sick, Avenue Cdt, Driss Al Harti - Ben M'Sick, Casablanca, Casablanca, B.P 7955, Morocco; Mohammadi Z., Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Kašpar J., Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Berčák R., Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Holuša J., Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Surový P., Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Marušák R., Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), Kamýcka 129, Suchdol, Praha 6, 16500, Czech Republic; Yousfi N., Hassan II University of Casablanca, Faculty of sciences Ben M'Sick, Avenue Cdt, Driss Al Harti - Ben M'Sick, Casablanca, Casablanca, B.P 7955, Morocco",EAAIE,,,,,,"M.

This paper focuses on increasingly widespread forest fires, causing greater destruction in recent years. Data obtained from sensors for predicting forest fires and assessing fire severity, i.e., area burned, are multivariate, seasonal, and highly imbalanced with a ratio of 100,000+ non-fire events to 1 fire event. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal Agnostic Sampling (STAS) to overcome the challenge of highly imbalanced data. This paper first presents a mathematical understanding of fire and non-fire events and then a thorough complexity analysis of the proposed STAS framework and two existing methods, NearMiss and SMOTE. Further, to investigate the applicability of STAS, binary classification models (to determine the probability of forest fire) and regression models (to assess the severity of forest fire) were built on the data generated from STAS. A total of 432 experiments were conducted to validate the robustness of the STAS parameters. Additional experiments with a temporal data split were conducted to further validate the results. The results show that 180 of the 216 binary classification models had an (Formula presented.) and 150 of the 216 regression models had an (Formula presented.). These results indicate the applicability of STAS for fire prediction with highly imbalanced multivariate seasonal time series data. © 2025 by the authors.",big data analytics; climate change; deep learning; evolving data; multivariate time series; natural fire disasters; nearmiss; real-time data sampling; sensors; SMOTE; under-sampling,Time series; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Data sampling; Deep learning; Evolving data; Fire disasters; Multivariate time series; Natural fire; Natural fire disaster; Near-misses; Real-time data; Real-time data sampling; SMOTE; Under-sampling; Agnostic; article; big data; binary classification; burn; climate change; deep learning; disaster; economic aspect; female; fire; forest fire; human; male; natural disaster; prediction; probability; sampling; sensor; time series analysis; Premixed flames,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217775920,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research aims to map areas susceptible to forest fires within the Triunfo do Xingu Environmental Protection Area, employing machine learning algorithms to ascertain the influence of environmental, topographic and socioeconomic factors on fire occurrence. For this purpose, the Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting regression models were used to predict kernel density values calculated over 15,291 confirmed burn points between 2010 and 2020, using 11 predictor factors, including Altitude, Slope, Aspect, Topographic Wetness Index, Precipitation, Temperature, Proximity to Inhabited areas, Proximity to Roads, Land Use and Cover, Vegetation Continuous Fields, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, the metrics used were Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, and the Coefficient of Determination. The test results showed that the models had similar performance, and both the Random Forest (RMSE = 36.26, MAE = 17.45, and R2 = 0.99) and the Extreme Gradient Boosting (RMSE = 35.73, MAE = 18.74, and R2 = 0.99) demonstrated good predictive capacity. The elaborated map presented areas of high and very high susceptibility occupying 39% of the total area of the conservation unit, mainly located in the central-east and central-west regions. The variables with the greatest importance and contribution to the final model were environmental and socioeconomic variables, notably precipitation, distance from inhabited areas, and land use type. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Amazon; Forest fire; Prediction; Random forest; Remote sensing; XGBoost,Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; forest fire; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; socioeconomic status; topography,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215381472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fire risk maps are an effective tool to quantify regional fire risk. Most existing studies on forest fire risk maps mainly use a single machine learning model, but different models have varying degrees of feature extraction in the same spatial environment, leading to inconsistencies in prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel integrated machine learning framework that systematically evaluates multiple models and combines their outputs through a weighted ensemble approach, thereby enhancing prediction robustness. During the feature selection stage, factors including socio-economic, climate, terrain, remote sensing data, and human factors were considered. Unlike previous studies that mainly use a single model, eight models were evaluated and compared using performance metrics. Three models were weighted based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) values, and cross-validation results showed an improvement in model performance. The integrated model achieved an accuracy of 0.8602, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.772, and superior sensitivity (0.9234), outperforming individual models. Finally, the weighted framework was applied to generate a fire risk map. Compared with prior studies, this multi-model ensemble approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also provides a scalable and adaptable framework for fire risk mapping, and provides valuable insights to address future fire sustainability issues. © 2025 by the authors.",fire risk zones; forest fire influencing factors; forest fire prediction; machine learning,Accuracy; Data; Fire Prevention; Forest Fires; Machinery; Maps; Models; Performance; Adversarial machine learning; Prediction models; Ensemble approaches; Fire risk zones; Fire risks; Forest fire influencing factor; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multiple machine; Risk maps; forest fire; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; sustainability; Premixed flames,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218456631,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While data-driven machine learning algorithms have advanced wildfire modeling, the quality of non-fire sample selection remains a significant limitation for model performance. This study proposes a spatial weight-based sampling method to improve non-fire sample quality, enhance model precision, and provide deeper insights into wildfire occurrence mechanisms. The study area is Yunnan Province, situated in southwest China, is dominated by mountainous landscapes and exhibits a significant susceptibility to wildfires. A spatial weighting model was developed using historical wildfire data (2011–2020), and threshold values were applied to divide different non-fire sample collection ranges. Four machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, RF, and DNN) were employed to construct prediction models, and their performance and spatial consistency were analyzed to determine the optimal sampling range and best-performing model. The results showed that (1) the optimal sampling weight range was 0–0.4, with RF achieving the best performance (AUC = 0.90). (2) The key factors influencing wildfire occurrence are population density and elevation. (3) The spatial weight-based sampling method demonstrated significant advantages in prediction accuracy and spatial consistency.

Accurately forecasting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) is crucial for mitigating wildfire risks and protecting ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure. This study analyzed FWI trends across the Continental United States (CONUS) from 2014 to 2023, using meteorological data from the gridMET dataset. Key variables, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, were utilized to calculate the FWI at a fine spatial resolution of 4 km, ensuring the precise identification of wildfire-prone areas. Based on this, our study developed a hybrid modeling framework to forecast FWI over a 14-day horizon, integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Autoregressive Networks (DeepAR). The models were evaluated using the Index of Agreement (IOA) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results revealed that the Southwest and West regions of CONUS consistently exhibited the highest mean FWI values, with the summer months demonstrating the greatest variability across all climatic zones. In terms of model performance on forecasting, Day 1 results highlighted the superior performance of the GNN-TCNN model, achieving an IOA of 0.95 and an RMSE of 1.21, compared to the GNN-LSTM (IOA: 0.93, RMSE: 1.25) and GNN-DeepAR (IOA: 0.92, RMSE: 1.30). On average, across all 14 days, the GNN-TCNN outperformed others with a mean IOA of 0.885 and an RMSE of 1.325, followed by the GNN-LSTM (IOA: 0.852, RMSE: 1.590) and GNN-DeepAR (IOA: 0.8225, RMSE: 1.755). The GNN-TCNN demonstrated robust accuracy across short-term (days 1–7) and long-term (days 8–14) forecasts.

Despite numerous predictive studies in this field, wildfire management still had uncertainties. The machine learning technique was popular on this topic, but it portrayed gaps of non-generalisable and inaccuracy possibilities. This study intended to apply nonparametric predictive inference (NPI) with a parametric copula to predict the next wildfire location using the coordinate parameters. The NPI quantifies the uncertainties via imprecise probabilities, (P, P), while the copula integration considers the spatial correlation by modelling the dependence structure between the past coordinates in predicting the next location. Unlike other methods, the NPI generates a set of bounded probabilities that provide confidence in the prediction result. This paper applied the proposed method to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite dataset for Indonesia (2020). Several wildfire hotspots in Sumatra and Kalimantan archipelago were focused on this study. It was evaluated via the differences (d̅) within the (P, P) and showcased low values (d̅ < 0.001). The results show that NPI with parametric copula was highly accurate for both archipelagoes, highlighting its generalisability specifically for Indonesia. Each wildfire hotspot had a different optimal copula to predict the best future hotspot. Clayton and Gumbel copulae were the best to be integrated with NPI to predict the next wildfire location in Sumatra while Normal and Gumbel copulae for Kalimantan locations. In conclusion, the NPI is considered a reliable alternative for wildfire location prediction. © 2025, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Zhejiang Province has the highest forest coverage rate in China, and forest fires are one of the main natural disasters impacting forest management in the region. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires based on the MODIS data from 2013 to 2023. The results showed that the annual incidence of forest fires in Zhejiang Province has shown an overall downward trend from 2013 to 2023, with forest fires occurring more frequently in winter and spring. By utilizing eight contributing factors of forest fire occurrence as variables, three models were constructed: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The RF and XGBoost models demonstrated high predictive ability, achieving accuracy rates of 0.85 and 0.92, f1-score of 0.84 and 0.92, and AUC values of 0.892 and 0.919, respectively. Further analysis using the RF and XGBoost models revealed that elevation and precipitation had the most significant effects on the occurrence of forest fires. Additionally, the predictions of forest fire risk generated by the RF and XGBoost models indicated that the incidence rate is high in the southern part of Zhejiang Province, particularly in the Wenzhou and Lishui areas, as well as in the southwest of the Hangzhou area and the north of the Quzhou area. In the future, the forest fire risk in this area can be predicted using site factors with the RF and XGBoost models, providing a scientific reference for forest management in Zhejiang Province and aiding in the prevention and mitigation of the impacts of forest fires. © 2024 by the authors.",forest fire; machine learning; MODIS; spatiotemporal analysis,Algorithms; Area; China; Data; Disasters; Forest Fires; Forest Management; Models; China; Zhejiang; Fire hazards; Forest ecology; Fire risks; Forest fires; Machine-learning; MODIS; Natural disasters; Random forests; Risk predictions; Spatiotemporal analysis; Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang province of China; algorithm; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; MODIS; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; Premixed flames,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213084753,Forests,"Economic Research Institute of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company, Hangzhou, 310000, China; Zhejiang Huayun Electric Power Engineering Design & Consultation Company Limited, Hangzhou, 310000, China","Bian R., Economic Research Institute of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company, Hangzhou, 310000, China; Chen K., Economic Research Institute of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company, Hangzhou, 310000, China; Li G., Economic Research Institute of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company, Hangzhou, 310000, China; Wang Z., Zhejiang Huayun Electric Power Engineering Design & Consultation Company Limited, Hangzhou, 310000, China; Qiu Y., Zhejiang Huayun Electric Power Engineering Design & Consultation Company Limited, Hangzhou, 310000, China; Bai H., Zhejiang Huayun Electric Power Engineering Design & Consultation Company Limited, Hangzhou, 310000, China; Kong W., Zhejiang Huayun Electric Power Engineering Design & Consultation Company Limited, Hangzhou, 310000, China",,,,,,,"W.

Existing methods to quantify this burn probability involve simulating the spread of many thousands of individual wildfires, making them highly computationally expensive. To reduce this expense, we propose strategies that enable the development of computationally efficient machine learning assisted metamodels for estimating burn probability, which are demonstrated for a case study in South Australia. Artificial neural networks are used as the metamodel to emulate the outputs of a landscape fire simulation model. Development of the metamodel is facilitated by reducing the input and output dimensionality of the simulation model by a factor of 10,000–1,000,000, while still being able to predict burn probabilities with high accuracy (approximately ± 7.4% error, on average) and only requiring 0.6% of the computational time compared with an approach using landscape fire simulation models. This opens the door to obtaining many thousands of spatially distributed estimates of burn probability, as is required when optimising fuel treatment strategies. © 2024 The Authors",Artificial neural network; Burn probability; Metamodeling; Simulation; Wildfire,"Fires; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks, Computer; Probability; Wildfires; Australia; South Australia; Digital elevation model; Dimensionality reduction; fuel; Burn probabilities; Computationally efficient; Dimensionality reduction; Fire simulation; Meta model; Metamodeling; Neural-networks; Simulation; Simulation model; Wildfire; artificial neural network; machine learning; probability; simulation; wildfire; Article; artificial neural network; calibration; case study; computational time; computer model; control strategy; correlation coefficient; data interpretation; dimensionality reduction; environmental risk; fire and fire related phenomena; intermethod comparison; landscape; mean absolute error; mean absolute percentage error; measurement accuracy; performance indicator; prediction; probability; risk reduction; root mean squared error; South Australia; spatial analysis; statistical error; time; validation study; wildfire; fire; machine learning; theoretical model; wildfire; Premixed flames",Academic Press,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207578606,J.

Timely responses can significantly reduce the damages and consequences caused by their spread. Several critical issues in wildfire behavior analysis include fire occurrence forecasting, early detection, and spread prediction. In this study, we focus on wildfire occurrence forecasting, which is a valuable tool for facilitating earlier intervention. Conventional approaches primarily rely on the computation of fire indices based on weather conditions. However, solutions that utilize more comprehensive environmental data, remote sensing information, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may offer substantial advantages for rapid decision-making and extensive territory monitoring. The wide variety of spatial environmental parameters and the great diversity of geographical regions that influence wildfire occurrence complicate this task. Consequently, there is no unified approach for predicting wildfire occurrences using remote sensing data and AI techniques. The goal of this study is to explore the potential of predicting wildfire occurrences using various available environmental parameters - meteorological, geo-spatial, and anthropogenic - and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We developed a unified pipeline for data acquisition and subsequent ML-based algorithm development. The comprehensive analysis includes the following algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, Autoencoder, ConvLSTM, Attention Multilayer Perceptron, and RegNetX. In addition, we explore several metrics to assess the quality of developed models in case of highly imbalanced spatio-temporal data. To conduct the study, we collected a unique dataset covering several large regions in central Russia, incorporating more than 17,000 verified wildfire events over a period of 10 years. The findings underscore the necessity of developing individual ML models tailored to each region, taking into account the specific environmental features correlated with the probability of fire occurrence. The quality of the achieved models, as measured by F1-score, varies from 0.7 to 0.87 depending on the region, demonstrating the potential of integrating such algorithms into emergency response systems. © The Author(s) 2025.",Classification; Computer vision; Deep learning; Fire spreading; Image processing; Remote sensing,,Nature Research,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001155713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the development of a peatland fire prediction model is necessary. This study aims to identify peatland fire vulnerability in Bengkalis Regency using burn area from MODIS 2019. The algorithm used are Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (Log-Reg), with independent variables including physiography, peat physical characteristics, anthropogenic factors, climate, and NDMI. The total burned area in Bengkalis Regency in 2019 was 175.85 km², with Rupat District being the area with the largest burned area. The best model is RF that was able to predict peatland fires in Bengkalis Regency effectively, with achieving an AUC value of 0.972. The five main factors influencing peatland fires were road density, precipitation, drainage density, NDMI, and river density. The accuracy of RF reached 95.07%. The classification results indicated three levels of peatland fire vulnerability in Bengkalis Regency • Non-Vulnerable: Areas classified as non-vulnerable are regions where the risk of peatland fires is minimal or non-existent. • Low Vulnerability: These areas have a moderate risk of peatland fires. • High Vulnerability: Areas with high vulnerability are the most susceptible to peatland fires. © 2024 The Authors",Bengkalis regency; Burn area; Logistic regression; Peatland fire; Random forest,algorithm; Article; classification; climate; controlled study; data accuracy; El Nino; environmental risk; geography; human impact (environment); independent variable; Indonesia; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; peat fire; peatland; precipitation; prediction; predictive model; predictor variable; random forest; response variable; river; sanitation; seashore; wildfire,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213216041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing physics-based models are limited in predicting large or long-duration wildfire events. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based predictive model, Fire-Image-DenseNet (FIDN), that uses spatial features derived from both near real-time and reanalysis data on the environmental and meteorological drivers of wildfire. We trained and tested this model using more than 300 individual wildfires that occurred between 2012 and 2019 in the western US. In contrast to existing models, the performance of FIDN does not degrade with fire size or duration. Furthermore, it predicts final burnt area accurately even in very heterogeneous landscapes in terms of fuel density and flammability. The FIDN model showed higher accuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) about 82% and 67% lower than those of the predictive models based on cellular automata (CA) and the minimum travel time (MTT) approaches, respectively. Its structural similarity index measure (SSIM) averages 97%, outperforming the CA and FlamMap MTT models by 6% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, FIDN is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than both CA and MTT models. The enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy advancements offer vital insights for strategic planning and resource allocation for firefighting operations. © 2024 The Authors",Cellular automata; Deep learning; Densenet; FlamMap; Wildfire prediction,Fire extinguishers; Mean square error; Network security; Prediction models; Resource allocation; Strategic planning; Travel time; Burnt areas; Cellular automatons; Deep learning; Densenet; Flammap; Minimum travel time; Predictive models; Remote sensing data; Travel time model; Wildfire prediction; cellular automaton; complexity; data set; environmental change; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; wildfire; Premixed flames,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210291944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leveraging a comprehensive forest fire database spanning from 2018 to 2022 and utilizing the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, 436 fire events ranging from 9 to 53,764.1 hectares were automatically detected and mapped using the difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Subsequently, a robust fire severity model was developed by incorporating 19 variables, including biophysical, topographic, climatic, and vegetation-related factors. The RF classification achieved noteworthy performance metrics, with an overall accuracy of 0.75, a Kappa value of 0.61, and a macro-average AUC value of 0.88. Furthermore, the integration of SHAP analysis provided insightful contributions to the RF classification model, elucidating the impacts of individual input features. Notably, variables such as NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index), LAI (Leaf Area Index), and LWVI (Land Water Vegetation Index) emerged as significant influencers, followed by WSPD (Wind Speed) and LST (Land Surface Temperature). Additionally, an analysis of fire severity distribution across fuel types (FMT) revealed intricate patterns, underscoring the complex relationships between vegetation composition and fire behavior. The findings of this study have implications for forest management and wildfire risk assessment, offering valuable insights for decision-making processes. Furthermore, the integration of SHAP analysis with RF classification enhances the interpretability and transparency of machine learning-based fire severity prediction models, contributing to the advancement of fire management strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Fire severity; Forest fire; Google Earth Engine; Random forest classification; SHAP,Turkey; Antiknock compounds; Atmospheric temperature; Decision making; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forest ecology; Premixed flames; Risk management; Tropics; Classification approach; Fire severity; Forest fires; Forested area; Google earth engine; Google earths; Prediction accuracy; Random forest classification; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; accuracy assessment; fire history; forest dynamics; forest management; integrated approach; leaf area index; prediction; Risk assessment,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204522240,Stoch.

The objective of this study is to develop an intelligent surveillance model for detection and classification of uncontrolled forest fires utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a forest fire dataset for drone applications. The goal is to develop an intelligent model that can detect wild forest fires and classify their severity. In this proposed system, the CNN consists of 13 layers, starting from the input layer, which is a single layer with dimensions proportional to the size of the image used, and ending with the output layer, which consists of three layers: the FC layer, the SoftMax classifier, and the classification outputs. It determines how many rows this convolutional neural network can use, and there are two categories (fire, no fire). In addition, there are 9 middle layers, where these layers are mainly repeated from the convolutional layer, Max Pooling, and ReLU. Where each layer has its own measurements, number of filters, and method of movement. Extensive simulations were conducted and the findings were recorded from several aspects. Through the results, there is a technical improvement in the proposed system in various measures. On the data set utilized, the proposed system yielded favorable outcomes, with an average prediction accuracy of 98%. ©2025 The authors.",classification; convolutional neural network; dataset for forest fire detection; deep learning; detection; forest fire; forest fire dataset for classification; surveillance model,,International Information and Engineering Technology Association,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219038336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reliance on traditional wildfire indices for forecasting wildfires has failed to provide the expected prediction outcomes, resulting in limited application of these models. Thus, this research compares the outcome of wildfire forecasting using fire danger rating indices against Machine Learning model outcomes. Furthermore, the performance effectiveness of the fire danger rating indices and Machine Learning model outcomes are assessed using the same wildfire incidents. The One-class Machine Learning algorithms used are Support Vector Machine, Isolation Forest, Neural network-based Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder models. The two global wildfire indices investigated were the US National Fire Danger Rating System for California and the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index for Western Australia, using similar features. For the same data sets, the National Fire Danger Rating System and the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index prediction outcomes were compared with Machine Learning model outcomes. Higher wildfire prediction accuracy was achieved by the One-class models, exceeding the performance of the two wildfire danger indices by at least 20%. The implications of our research findings have the potential to influence both these wildfire indices and state-of-the-art methods in wildfire prediction by proposing alternative ML methods to model the onset of wildfires. © The Author(s) 2024.",Machine learning; One-class models; Wildfire equations,Australia; assessment method; comparative study; machine learning; prediction; support vector machine; wildfire,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199519711,Nat.

EO4WildFires integrates multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, SAR data from Sentinel-1, and meteorological data from NASA Power annotated with EFFIS data for forest fire detection and size estimation. These data cover 45 countries with a total of 31,730 wildfire events from 2018 to 2022. All of these various sources of data are archived into data cubes, with the intention of assessing wildfire severity by considering both current and historical forest conditions, utilizing a broad range of data including temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture. The experimental setup has been arranged to test the effectiveness of different deep learning architectures in predicting the size and shape of wildfire-burned areas. This study incorporates both image segmentation networks and visual transformers, employing a consistent experimental design across various models to ensure the comparability of the results. Adjustments were made to the training data, such as the exclusion of empty labels and very small events, to refine the focus on more significant wildfire events and potentially improve prediction accuracy. The models’ performance was evaluated using metrics like F1 score, IoU score, and Average Percentage Difference (aPD). These metrics offer a multi-faceted view of model performance, assessing aspects such as precision, sensitivity, and the accuracy of the burned area estimation. Through extensive testing the final model utilizing LinkNet and ResNet-34 as backbones, we obtained the following metric results on the test set: 0.86 F1 score, 0.75 IoU, and 70% aPD. These results were obtained when all of the available samples were used. When the empty labels were absent during the training and testing, the model increased its performance significantly: 0.87 F1 score, 0.77 IoU, and 44.8% aPD. This indicates that the number of samples, as well as their respectively size (area), tend to have an impact on the model’s robustness. This restriction is well known in the remote sensing domain, as accessible, accurately labeled data may be limited. Visual transformers like TeleViT showed potential but underperformed compared to segmentation networks in terms of F1 and IoU scores. © 2024 by the authors.",deep learning; earth observation; forest wildfires; machine learning; multi-sensor data; remote sensing; training dataset,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210425066,Fire,"Informatics Laboratory, Department of Agricultural Economics & Rural Development, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, 11855, Greece","Sykas D., Informatics Laboratory, Department of Agricultural Economics & Rural Development, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, 11855, Greece; Zografakis D., Informatics Laboratory, Department of Agricultural Economics & Rural Development, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, 11855, Greece; Demestichas K., Informatics Laboratory, Department of Agricultural Economics & Rural Development, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, 11855, Greece",,,,,,,"D.

To reduce the damages experienced by bushfires, predicting Australian bushfire ignition allows for an early warning system to give first responders and disaster managers prompt and accurate information. Traditional methods of bushfire ignition prediction suffer from incorporating large-dimensional data and take extensive computational time. Applying machine learning (ML) models enhances accuracy and reduces the computational time required to predict bushfire ignition. This study proposes a predictive model that can take meteorological and topographical data and determine the probability of Australian bushfire ignition and severity using historical fire detection gathered from the Black Summer Bushfire Disaster. The Black Summer Bushfire Disaster occurred between December 2019 and February 2020. The fires affected numerous towns throughout Victoria, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory; hence, the varying topographical and meteorological conditions allow fire ignition and severity influences to be explored. The proposed methodology incorporates Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and K-nearest Neighbour (kNN) Algorithms. The proposed method relies on five datasets. Meteorological data is sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), Australia. Topographic data is sourced from Geoscience Australia and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Aqua and Terra satellites, which utilize a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Active Fire Point Data is also sourced from NASA MODIS, which can detect fires. The proposed methodology aims to act as an early warning system by providing a fire occurrence and fire intensity warning map and the probability of fire occurrence and fire intensity depending on the current meteorological climate. © 2024 The Author(s)",Australian bushfire; Black summer disaster; Machine learning (ML); Meteorological data; Predictive analytics; Topographic data,,Elsevier Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212329288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional machine learning methods face challenges in forest fire prediction, such as difficulty identifying feature parameters, manual intervention in model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, which affect prediction accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes an analytical framework for forest fire prediction based on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) technology to address the challenges traditional machine learning methods face in forest fire prediction. We collected meteorological, topographical, and vegetation data from Guangxi Province, with meteorological data covering 1994 to 2023, providing comprehensive background information for our prediction model. Using the prediction model, which was constructed with the AutoGluon framework, the experimental results indicate that models under the AutoGluon framework (e.g., KNeighborsDist classifier) significantly outperform traditional machine learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, with the highest accuracy rate reaching 0.960. Model error analysis shows that models under the AutoGluon framework perform better in error control. This study provides an efficient and accurate method for forest fire prediction, which is of great significance for decision-making in forest fire management and for protecting forest resources and ecological security. © 2024 by the authors.",AutoGluon framework; automated machine learning; climate factors; forest fire prediction; model evaluation,Adversarial machine learning; Decision making; Fire hazards; Forest ecology; Machine learning; Premixed flames; Weather forecasting; Autogluon framework; Automated machine learning; Automated machines; Climate factors; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Model evaluation; Prediction modelling; accuracy assessment; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; error analysis; fire management; forecasting method; forest fire; forest management; machine learning; numerical model; precision; topographic effect; Prediction models,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213081810,Atmosphere,"School of Information Management, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China","Zhang S., School of Information Management, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Pan M., School of Information Management, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China",,,,,,,"M.

Accurately mapping wildfire severity (WSM) using remote sensing and machine learning (ML) is critical for evaluating damages, informing recovery efforts, and guiding long-term mitigation strategies. Stacking ensemble ML (SEML) enhances predictive accuracy and robustness by combining multiple diverse models into a single meta-learned predictor. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of individual base learners while reducing variance, ultimately improving model reliability. This study aims to optimize a SEML framework to (1) identify the most effective ML models for use as base learners and meta-learners, and (2) determine the optimal number of base models needed for robust and accurate wildfire severity predictions. The study utilizes six ML models—Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Adaptive Boosting (AB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—to construct an SEML. To quantify wildfire impacts, we extracted 118 spectral indices from post-fire Landsat-8 data and incorporated four additional predictors (land cover, elevation, slope, and aspect). A dataset of 911 CBI observations from 18 wildfire events was used for training, and models were validated through cross-validation and bootstrapping to ensure robustness. To address multicollinearity and reduce computational complexity, we applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and condensed the dataset into three primary components. Our results indicated that simpler models, notably LR and KNN, performed well as meta-learners, with LR achieving the highest predictive accuracy. Moreover, using only two base learners (RF and SVM) was sufficient to realize optimal SEML performance, with an overall accuracy and precision of 0.661, recall of 0.662, and F1-score of 0.656. These findings demonstrate that SEML can enhance wildfire severity mapping by improving prediction accuracy and supporting more informed resource allocation and management decisions. Future research should explore additional meta-learning approaches and incorporate emerging remote sensing data sources such as hyperspectral and LiDAR. © 2025 by the authors.",Landsat satellite; stacking ensemble machine learning; wildfire management; wildfire severity mapping,Adaptive boosting; Contrastive Learning; Damage detection; Federated learning; Landsat; Nearest neighbor search; Photomapping; Premixed flames; Random forests; Support vector regression; Base learners; Landsat satellite; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Predictive accuracy; Stacking ensemble machine learning; Stackings; Wildfire management; Wildfire severity; Wildfire severity mapping; Adversarial machine learning,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000763176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method proposed herein leverages diverse data sources – including L8 optical imagery, S1 (C-band) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, PL (L-band) SAR imagery, and terrain features – to capture comprehensive information about fuel types and distributions. An ensemble model was trained to predict landscape-scale fuels – such as the ’Scott and Burgan 40’ – using the as-received Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field survey plot data obtained from the USDA Forest Service. However, this basic approach yielded relatively poor results due to the inadequate amount of training data. Pseudo-labeled and fully synthetic datasets were developed using generative AI approaches to address the limitations of ground truth data availability. These synthetic datasets were used for augmenting the FIA data from California to enhance the robustness and coverage of model training. The use of an ensemble of methods – including deep learning neural networks, decision trees, and gradient boosting – offered a fuel mapping accuracy of nearly 80%. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated for regions of the 2021 Dixie and Caldor fires. Comparative analyses against high-resolution data from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and timber harvest maps affirmed the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach, which is capable of near-real-time fuel mapping. © 2025 The Authors",Ensemble model; Fuels mapping; Machine learning; Synthetic data generation; Wildfires,California; United States; algorithm; imagery; machine learning; mapping; modeling; synthetic aperture radar; timber harvesting; wildfire,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000798940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although deep learning models outperform traditional methods in predicting wildfires, their accuracy drops to about 90% when using remotely sensed data. To effectively monitor and predict fires, this project aims to develop deep learning models capable of processing multivariate remotely sensed global data in real time. This project innovatively uses SimpleGAN, SparseGAN, and CGAN combined with sliding windows for data augmentation. Among these, CGAN demonstrates superior performance. Additionally, for the prediction classification task, U-Net, ConvLSTM, and Attention ConvLSTM are explored, achieving accuracies of 94.53%, 95.85%, and 93.40%, respectively, with ConvLSTM showing the best performance. The study focuses on a region in the Republic of the Congo, where predictions were made and compared with future data. The results showed significant overlap, highlighting the model’s effectiveness.

Chile, with its diverse geography and climate, faces escalating wildfire frequency and intensity due to climate change. This study employs a spatial machine learning approach using a Random Forest algorithm to predict wildfire risk in Central and Southern Chile under current and future climatic scenarios. The model was trained on a time series dataset incorporating climatic, land use, and physiographic variables, with burned-area scars as the response variable. By applying this model to three projected climate scenarios, this study forecasts the spatial distribution of wildfire probabilities for multiple future periods. The model’s performance was high, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.91 for testing and 0.87 for validation. The accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), and True Negative Rate (TNR) values were 0.80, 0.87, and 0.73, respectively. Currently, the prediction of wildfire risk in Mediterranean-type climate areas and the central Araucanía are most at risk, particularly in agricultural zones and rural–urban interfaces. However, future projections indicate a southward expansion of wildfire risk, with an overall increase in probabilities as climate scenarios become more pessimistic. These findings offer a framework for policymakers, facilitating evidence-based strategies for adaptive land management and effective mitigation of wildfire risk. © 2025 by the authors.",climate change scenarios; fire risk prediction; Random Forest; spatial modeling; wildfires,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001145407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate and timely fire prediction is essential to mitigate these risks and improve fire management strategies. This study develops and evaluates advanced Deep Learning (DL) models for FF prediction by integrating spatiotemporal vegetation indices, environmental data, and human activity indicators. Specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) models were employed to analyze Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and weather data, along with anthropogenic factors such as beekeeping, tourism, agriculture, and deforestation rates. Leveraging this diverse, high-dimensional dataset, the ConvLSTM model engineered to capture intricate spatial and temporal relationships delivered superior performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9785 and Accuracy 98.08%, surpassing the LSTM and CNN models. Integrating human-induced activities with environmental data, these models provide accurate and actionable predictions for fire management in high-risk areas.

This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as vegetation recovery and socio-economic factors, to refine predictions. This study provides critical insights for targeted fire management and land use planning, promoting the sustainable conservation of the Caatinga under changing climatic conditions. © 2024 by the authors.",climate change; disturbance; drylands; fire dynamics; fire niche; fire susceptibility; Maxent; semiarid,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216269141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effectively suppressing large wildfires requires a thorough understanding of containment opportunities across landscapes, to which empirical spatial modelling can contribute largely. The previous containment model in Catalonia failed to account for the crucial roles of weather conditions, lacked temporal prediction and could not forecast windows for containment opportunities, prompting this research. We employed a detailed geospatial approach to assess the spatial-temporal variations in containment probability for escaped wildfires in Catalonia. Using machine learning algorithms, geospatial data, and 124 historical wildfire perimeters from 2000 to 2015, we developed a predictive model with high accuracy (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve = 0.81 ± 0.03) over 32,108 km2 at a 30-meter resolution. Our analysis identified agricultural plains near non-burnable barriers, such as major road corridors, as having the highest containment probability. Conversely, steep mountainous regions with limited accessibility exhibited lower containment success rates. We also found temperature and windspeed to be critical factors influencing containment success. These findings inform optimal firefighting resource allocation and contribute to strategic fuel management initiatives to enhance firefighting operations. © 2025 The Author(s).

Therefore, it is essential to identify and predict areas susceptible to fires, particularly in a country like China, where environmental and social conditions have undergone significant changes. In this study, we analyzed the spatial patterns of fires in distinct forest ecosystems across China. By incorporating RS and GIS technologies, and machine learning methodologies, we examined the factors influencing fires and developed a susceptibility model for different forest ecosystems. To generate fire susceptibility maps, we employed three machine learning models to establish connections between fire occurrences data and 17 predictor variables including climate, topography, vegetation, and human disturbances, namely artificial neural network, random forest, and the extreme gradient boosting models. The results showed that the fire points in different forest ecosystems showed a significant clustering distribution in space, and the driving factors of fire were different. We observed satisfactory performance across all the fire prediction models employed. Specially, extreme gradient boosting model exhibited superior performance with an AUC = 0.82–0.95; accuracy = 0.79–0.87; recall = 0.78–0.89; and F-Measure = 0.78–0.86. Forest fires in Heilongjiang Province are mainly caused by vegetation factors, while in Sichuan, human factors are the primary cause of fire incidents. Topographical factors play a crucial role in influencing the occurrence of forest fires in Shanxi and Fujian. Climate factors play a crucial role in Guangdong and Yunnan. The temporal and spatial patterns of fires in various ecosystems could be analyzed in combination with forest fire factors, providing important scientific information for regional forest fire early warning and monitoring. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Fire susceptibility; Forest management; Geospatial analysis; Wildfires; XGBoost,Premixed flames; Driving factors; Fire occurrences; Fire susceptibility; Forest ecosystem; Forest fires; Geo-spatial analysis; Gradient boosting; Spatial patterns; Wildfire; Xgboost; Forest ecology,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215213802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As wildfires are also affected by climate change, extreme wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent. Although they occur less frequently globally than those sparked by human activities, lightning-ignited wildfires play a substantial role in carbon emissions and account for the majority of burned areas in certain regions. While existing computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves classifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating with high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a wide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation. Utilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in lightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on this phenomenon. We analyze the influence of various features on the models using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks. Our findings highlight significant global differences between anthropogenic and lightning-ignited wildfires. Moreover, we demonstrate that, even over a short time span of less than a decade, climate changes have steadily increased the global risk of lightning-ignited wildfires. This distinction underscores the imperative need for dedicated predictive models and fire weather indices tailored specifically to each type of wildfire. © The Author(s) 2025.",,article; carbon emission; climate change; computer model; explainable artificial intelligence; explainable machine learning; fire; human activities; lightning; machine learning; meteorology; natural disaster; prediction; predictive model; probability; vegetation; weather; wildfire,Nature Research,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000287187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forest fires contributed to the ecological balance by destroying old and diseased plant material; but in the modern era fires are a major problem that tests the endurance not only of government agencies around the world, but also have an effect on climate change. Forest fires have become more intense, more destructive, and more deadly; these are known as megafires. They can cause major economic and ecological problems, especially in the summer months (dry season). However, humanity has developed a tool that can predict fire events, to detect them in time, but also to predict their duration. This tool is artificial intelligence, specifically, machine learning, which is one part of AI. Consequently, this paper briefly mentions several methods of machine learning as used in predicting forest fires and in early detection, submitting an overall review of current models. Our main overall objective is to venture into a new field: predicting the duration of ongoing forest fires. Our contribution offers a new way to manage forest fires, using accessible open data, available from the Hellenic Fire Service. In particular, we imported over 72,000 data from a 10-year period (2014–2023) using machine learning techniques. The experimental and validation results are more than encouraging, with Random Forest achieving the lowest value for the error range (8–13%), meaning it was 87–92% accurate on the prediction of forest fire duration. Finally, some future directions in which to extend this research are presented. © 2024 by the authors.",decision trees; forest fires; machine learning; neural networks,Adversarial machine learning; Climate change; Fire hazards; Premixed flames; Random forests; Ecological balance; Ecological problem; Economic problems; Forest fires; Government agencies; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Plant material; Summer months; Forest ecology,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210244267,Future Internet,"Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, 45110, Greece; Department of Economics, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, 45110, Greece","Kopitsa C., Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, 45110, Greece; Tsoulos I.G., Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, 45110, Greece; Charilogis V., Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, 45110, Greece; Stavrakoudis A., Department of Economics, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, 45110, Greece",,,,,,,"I.G.

We used 14 potentially influencing variables, four climatic factors, two anthropogenic, four topographic and four factors related to vegetation characteristics. The h-FIS method, together with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Randon Forest (RF) was implemented for the year 2018, 2019 and 2020, based on training (70%) and test (30%) data. The most important variables selected by the Boruta algorithm were considered. The prediction success of each map was determined using the ROC curve, AUC and global accuracy. The results obtained showed that the most important factors for predicting fires are land cover and use, air humidity, soil moisture, precipitation and elevation. In the three years analyzed, the h-FIS model demonstrated slightly higher performance compared to the SVM and RF models. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the h-FIS method identified 8.62%, 16.81% and 19.64% of the area as high and with very high susceptibility. The accuracy values based on independent data showed the h-FIS model to be of a good design (AUC = 92.5% and accuracy = 0.924 in 2018, AUC = 93.3% and accuracy = 0.9315 in 2019, and AUC = 90.4% and accuracy = 0.8991 in 2020) and, with the predicted susceptibility map, the relationship between the number of occurrences of fire observed in the high and very high fire susceptibility classes indicated a success rate of greater than 0.77%. These results confirm the efficiency of the proposed method, proving it to be suitable for the mapping of susceptibility to outbreaks of fire, and it can be used to assist public managers with fire prevention and mitigation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Boruta method; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid fuzzy inference system; Machine learning,Brazil; Ibiuna Plateau; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; elevation; fuzzy mathematics; hazard assessment; humidity; land cover; land use; machine learning; precipitation (climatology); soil moisture; support vector machine; training; vegetation,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201288815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, traditional approaches often rely on fixed thresholds and supervised learning techniques, which may fail to account for the complex spatiotemporal dynamics associated with forest fire events. To overcome this limitation, an adaptive deep learning model is proposed and specifically designed for early forest fire monitoring. This model integrates Stacking ConvLSTM to forecast mid-infrared brightness temperatures and employs a non-parametric dynamic thresholding method based on Otsu's algorithm for spatiotemporal anomaly detection, facilitating the identification of potential hotspots. By effectively capturing complex dependencies within spatiotemporal dimensions, this method improves detection accuracy. Furthermore, high-confidence early fire points are determined through dual-band analysis and land cover detection. Comparative experiments utilizing Himawari-8/9 satellite data reveal that the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques as well as the latest temporal methods, achieving an accuracy of 0.995, precision of 0.985, recall of 0.946, and an F1 score of 0.965. Additionally, our method demonstrates an average fire detection delay of just 7 minutes and an average runtime of 71 seconds, underscoring its effectiveness in early forest fire detection. This approach serves as a robust tool for enhancing forest fire monitoring systems, offering significant implications for reducing response times and mitigating fire-related damages. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",ConvLSTM; Himawair-8/9; Spatiotemporal Anomaly Detection; Wildfire,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001146350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forest fires have increased significantly in recent years due to natural and artificial climatic factors. Therefore, accurate and early prediction of fires is essential. While significant advancements have been made in traditional and Deep Learning (DL) methods for fire detection, challenges remain in accurately pinpointing and recognizing fire regions, especially in diverse and large environments, to prevent damage effectively. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Federated Learning (FL)-based method called Indoor-Outdoor FireNet (IOFireNet) for detecting and localizing fire regions. The proposed method incorporates a Bilateral Filter (BF) to effectively preprocess fire images to reduce noise artifacts and enhance detection clarity. It employs Super Pixel-based Adaptive Clustering (SPAC) to precisely segment fire and non-fire regions. A global IOFireNet model is developed to aggregate parameters from local models, improving detection accuracy across varied environments, while MobileNet is used for efficient data processing, enabling predictions on fire spread, severity, and affected areas to support early warnings. The proposed FL-based IOFireNet attains an accuracy rate of 98.65% for fire detection and 97.14% of mean IoU for segmentation. The proposed SPAC model reaches a mean IoU of 4.06%, which is 2.45% better than the graph cut algorithm and CRF model. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.23%, 4.20%, 3.29%, and 10.02%, better than VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception, and Dense Net, respectively. © The Author(s) 2024.",Bilateral Filter; Federated Learning; Fire detection; IOFireNet; Superpixel Based Adaptive Clustering,algorithm; article; controlled study; data processing; deep learning; diagnosis; diagnostic test accuracy study; federated learning; filter; fire; forest fire; human; male; noise; prediction; residual neural network,Nature Research,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211172229,Sci.

Vegetation fires consists of forest fires, cropland fires, and other vegetation fires in this study. Currently, there is a limited amount of research on the long-term prediction of vegetation fires in Pakistan. The exact effect of every factor on the frequency of vegetation fires remains unclear when using standard analysis. This research utilized the high proficiency of machine learning algorithms to combine data from several sources, including the MODIS Global Fire Atlas dataset, topographic, climatic conditions, and different vegetation types acquired between 2001 and 2022. We tested many algorithms and ultimately chose four models for formal data processing. Their selection was based on their performance metrics, such as accuracy, computational efficiency, and preliminary test results. The model’s logistic regression, a random forest, a support vector machine, and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting were used to identify and select the nine key factors of forest and cropland fires and, in the case of other vegetation, seven key factors that cause a fire in Pakistan. The findings indicated that the vegetation fire prediction models achieved prediction accuracies ranging from 78.7 to 87.5% for forest fires, 70.4 to 84.0% for cropland fires, and 66.6 to 83.1% for other vegetation. Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) values ranged from 83.6 to 93.4% in forest fires, 72.6 to 90.6% in cropland fires, and 74.2 to 90.7% in other vegetation. The random forest model had the highest accuracy rate of 87.5% in forest fires, 84.0% in cropland fires, and 83.1% in other vegetation and also the highest AUC value of 93.4% in forest fires, 90.6% in cropland fires, and 90.7% in other vegetation, proving to be the most optimal performance model. The models provided predictive insights into specific conditions and regional susceptibilities to fire occurrences, adding significant value beyond the initial MODIS detection data. The maps generated to analyze Pakistan’s vegetation fire risk showed the geographical distribution of areas with high, moderate, and low vegetation fire risks, highlighting predictive risk assessments rather than historical fire detections. © The Author(s) 2024.",Crop fire; Forest fire; Machine learning; Other vegetation fire; Prediction models,Pakistan; algorithm; comparative study; data processing; detection method; fire behavior; fire management; forest fire; geographical distribution; hazard assessment; machine learning; MODIS; prediction; risk assessment; topographic effect; vegetation cover,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196834444,Fire Ecol.,"Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants, Ministry of Education, College of Tropical Crops Hainan University, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China; State Forestry and Grassland Administration Key Laboratory of Forest Resources and Environmental Management, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Key Laboratory for Silviculture and Conservation of Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Institute of Forest Science, University of Swat, Main Campus Charbagh, Swat, 19120, Pakistan; Department of Forestry, The University of Agriculture Dera Ismail Khan, Dera Ismail Khan, 29050, Pakistan; State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing, 100101, China","Shahzad F., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Mehmood K., Key Laboratory for Silviculture and Conservation of Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China, Institute of Forest Science, University of Swat, Main Campus Charbagh, Swat, 19120, Pakistan; Hussain K., State Forestry and Grassland Administration Key Laboratory of Forest Resources and Environmental Management, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Haidar I., Key Laboratory for Silviculture and Conservation of Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China, Institute of Forest Science, University of Swat, Main Campus Charbagh, Swat, 19120, Pakistan; Anees S.A., Department of Forestry, The University of Agriculture Dera Ismail Khan, Dera Ismail Khan, 29050, Pakistan; Muhammad S., Institute of Forest Science, University of Swat, Main Campus Charbagh, Swat, 19120, Pakistan; Ali J., Key Laboratory for Silviculture and Conservation of Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Adnan M., State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing, 100101, China; Wang Z., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Feng Z., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China, Key Laboratory of Genetics and Germplasm Innovation of Tropical Special Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants, Ministry of Education, College of Tropical Crops Hainan University, Hainan University, Haikou, 570228, China",,,,,,,"Z.

This study evaluates the efficacy of the multi-layer stacking ensemble Machine Learning (ML) method for forest fire susceptibility mapping, presenting a comparative case study within the Malakand division of Pakistan. Our extensive literature review shows that the present ML model has never been used in Pakistan’s forest fire scenarios. We employed several benchmark models for comparative evaluation, including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). A comprehensive fire inventory database was constructed, including satellite and ground hotspot data and relevant influencing factors. The fire probability indices from the six models were analyzed and validated using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1 score evaluation metrics. According to the Performance Evaluation Outcomes, the multi-layer stacking ensemble model provides the best outcomes in terms of accuracy 96.24%, AUC 99.43%, precision 97.81%, recall 94.59%, and F1 96.17% metrics. These results underscore the model’s potential as an effective new forest fire Probability mapping tool. Given its evidenced effectiveness, local forestry authorities in the Malakand division should consider its application for enhanced forestry conservation management and fire prevention strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",Forest fire; Machine learning; Malakand division; Multi-layer ensemble model; Probability mapping,Pakistan; conservation management; disaster management; forest fire; forest management; land use planning; literature review; mapping method; strategic approach,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218497577,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several adverse outcomes can result from this, including climatic shifts and greenhouse effects. The ramifications of fire incidents extend widely, impacting human communities, financial resources, the natural environment, and global warming. Therefore, timely fire detection is essential for quick and effective response and not to endanger forest resources, animal life, and the human economy. This study introduces a forest fire detection approach utilizing transfer learning with the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) pretraining model and the TranSDet model, which integrates an improved deep learning algorithm. Transfer Learning based on pre-trained YoloV8 enhances a fast and accurate object detection aggregate with the TranSDet structure to detect small fires. Furthermore, to train the model, we collected 5200 images and performed augmentation techniques for data, such as rotation, scaling, and changing due and saturation. Small fires can be detected from a distance by our suggested model both during the day and at night. Objects with similarities can lead to false predictions. However, the dataset augmentation technique reduces the feasibility. The experimental results prove that our proposed model can successfully achieve 98% accuracy to minimize catastrophic incidents. In recent years, the advancement of deep learning techniques has enhanced safety and secure environments. Lastly, we conducted a comparative analysis of our method’s performance based on widely used evaluation metrics to validate the achieved results. © 2024 by the authors.",brushfire spread; deep learning; fire detection; forest fire; TranSDet; wildfire incidents; YOLOv8,Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire detectors; Fire hazards; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Object detection; Object recognition; Brushfire spread; Deep learning; Fire detection; Forest fire detection; Forest fires; Small fire; Transdet; Transfer learning; Wildfire incident; You only look once version 8; Fires,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194238112,Process.,"Department of Computer Engineering, Gachon University, Sujeong-gu, Gyeonggi-do, Seongnam-si, 461-701, South Korea; Department of Information Systems and Technologies, Tashkent State University of Economics, Tashkent, 100066, Uzbekistan","Yunusov N., Department of Computer Engineering, Gachon University, Sujeong-gu, Gyeonggi-do, Seongnam-si, 461-701, South Korea; Islam B.M.D.S., Department of Computer Engineering, Gachon University, Sujeong-gu, Gyeonggi-do, Seongnam-si, 461-701, South Korea; Abdusalomov A., Department of Computer Engineering, Gachon University, Sujeong-gu, Gyeonggi-do, Seongnam-si, 461-701, South Korea, Department of Information Systems and Technologies, Tashkent State University of Economics, Tashkent, 100066, Uzbekistan; Kim W., Department of Computer Engineering, Gachon University, Sujeong-gu, Gyeonggi-do, Seongnam-si, 461-701, South Korea",,,,,,,"W.

Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) combined with three meta-heuristic algorithms – Whale Optimization (WOA), Black Widow Optimization (BWO), and Butterfly Optimization (BOA) – were employed to map areas susceptible to wildfire. To generate a wildfire inventory, 1408 wildfire points were identified within the study area from 2004 to 2022. The four ML models (XGBoost, WOA-XGBoost, BWO-XGBoost, and BOA-XGBoost) were run using 14 wildfire-conditioning factors categorized into four main groups: topographical, meteorological, vegetation, and anthropogenic. Six performance metrics – sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), and the average precision (AP) of Precision–Recall Curves (PRCs) – were used to compare the predictive performance of the ML models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was also used to interpret the importance values of the 14 influential variables for the modeling of wildfire on Hawaiʻi Island using the four models. The results of the wildfire modeling indicated that all four models performed well, with the BWO-XGBoost model exhibiting a slightly higher prediction performance (AUC = 0.9269), followed by WOA-XGBoost (AUC = 0.9253), BOA-XGBoost (AUC = 0.9232), and XGBoost (AUC = 0.9164). SHAP analysis revealed that the distance from a road, annual temperature, and elevation were the most influential factors. The wildfire susceptibility maps generated in this study can be used by local authorities for wildfire management and fire suppression activity. © 2023",Black widow optimization; Butterfly optimization; Hawaiʻi; Whale optimization; Wildfire susceptibility mapping,Algorithms; Hawaii; Machine Learning; Meteorology; Wildfires; Hawaiian Islands; Fires; Heuristic algorithms; Machine learning; Black widow optimization; Butterfly optimization; Hawai'i; Optimisations; Susceptibility mapping; Whale optimization; Wildfire susceptibilities; Wildfire susceptibility mapping; butterfly; elevation; machine learning; mapping; optimization; plantation forestry; wildfire; area under the curve; Article; artificial neural network; benchmarking; comparative study; Hawaii; machine learning; metaheuristics; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; temperature; vegetation; wildfire; algorithm; machine learning; meteorology; Optimization,Academic Press,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178495126,J.

This research focuses on Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) states in central India, where forest fire risk has become particularly pronounced. The primary objectives of the study are to quantify and map the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires over the period 2001 to 2020, and to predict future fire risks using satellite derived datasets and machine learning techniques. Through a long-term analysis, the study revealed an alarming increase in the number of forest fire incidents in MP and CG. From an average of 1200 and 1000 during 2001 to 2005, the incidents increased to 2800 and 2100 during 2016 to 2020, in MP and CG respectively. To predict forest fire risk, Random Forest machine learning algorithm was adopted utilizing various satellite derived climatic, topographical, and ecological parameters such as temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, NDVI, soil moisture, litter availability, evapotranspiration and terrain parameters (at monthly scale for 20 years). While forecasting fire probability for 2018–2020, the model achieves high accuracy rate of 86.46 % in MP and 93.78 % in CG. The results highlight significant forest fire likelihood regions in the central MP and the Southern CG, identifying areas requiring enhanced fire management strategies. This study has revealed that NDVI and rainfall have played a positive role in restricting the forest fire, and their negative anomaly amplified the fire risk. The study would help forest planners and administrators to characterise vulnerable areas and prioritise their conservation provisions. © 2023 COSPAR",- Random Forest Regression; Central India; Ensemble machine learning; Forest Fire; MODIS active fire data,Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Global warming; Learning algorithms; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil moisture; - random forest regression; Active fires; Central India; Chhattisgarh; Ensemble machine learning; Fire risks; Forest fires; Machine-learning; MODIS active fire data; Random forests; Machine learning,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85184667304,Adv.

Satellite remote sensing technology plays a pivotal role in wildfire monitoring and risk assessment, providing extensive geographical coverage and continuous monitoring capabilities. Traditional methods for predicating wildfire risk, however, face limitations in processing large-scale remote sensing data, especially in cloud detection and temporal information analysis. In response to this challenge, a novel set of image processing algorithms has been developed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of wildfire risk prediction. Initially, a cloud detection and removal algorithm based on deep learning is introduced. This algorithm effectively identifies and eliminates cloud interference in remote sensing images, thereby significantly improving the quality and usability of image data. Subsequently, a temporal information capturing technique is proposed, capable of processing vast amounts of remote sensing data and extracting time series features. This technique provides robust data support for wildfire risk prediction. The application of these technologies not only improves the efficiency of the data processing workflow but also enhances the timeliness and accuracy of the prediction model, holding significant practical importance for guiding actual wildfire prevention and response measures. © 2024 by the authors of this article.",cloud detection; deep learning; image processing algorithm; satellite remote sensing; temporal information; wildfire risk prediction,Data handling; Deep learning; Efficiency; Fires; Forecasting; Global warming; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Remote sensing; Satellites; Cloud detection; Deep learning; Image processing algorithm; Large-scales; Remote sensing data; Risk predictions; Satellite remote sensing; Temporal information; Wildfire risk prediction; Wildfire risks; Risk assessment,International Federation of Engineering Education Societies (IFEES),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191702400,Int.

In this study, we investigate potential changes in the fire susceptibility of areas in South Korea arising from climate change. We constructed a dataset of large-scale forest fires from the past decade and employed it in machine learning models that integrate climatic, socioeconomic, and environmental variables to assess the risk of forest fires. According to the results of these models, the eastern region is identified as highly vulnerable to forest fires during the baseline period, while the western region is classified as relatively safe. However, in the future, certain areas along the western coast are predicted to become more susceptible to forest fires. Consequently, as climate change continues, the risk of domestic forest fires is expected to increase, leading to the need for proactive prevention measures and careful management. This study contributes to the understanding of forest fire occurrences under diverse climate scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.",climate change; ensemble; forest fire; machine learning; South Korea,Damage; Deforestation; Forest Fires; Korea; Models; Probability; Risk Assessment; South Korea; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Large datasets; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Case-studies; Ensemble; Ensemble techniques; Forest fires; Large scale fires; Machine-learning; Potential change; Republic of Korea; South Korea; Widespread damage; climate change; data set; forest fire; machine learning; prediction; probability; Climate change,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188727183,Forests,"Department of Forestry, Environment, and Systems, Kookmin University, 77 Jeongneungro, Seongbukgu, Seoul, 02707, South Korea; Department of Forest Resources, Kookmin University, 77 Jeongneungro, Seongbukgu,, Seoul, 02707, South Korea; Korea Adaptation Center for Climate Change, Korea Environment Institute, Sejong, 30147, South Korea; College of General Education, Kookmin University, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul, Seongbukgu, 02707, South Korea","Ahn H.K., Department of Forestry, Environment, and Systems, Kookmin University, 77 Jeongneungro, Seongbukgu, Seoul, 02707, South Korea, Department of Forest Resources, Kookmin University, 77 Jeongneungro, Seongbukgu,, Seoul, 02707, South Korea; Jung H., Korea Adaptation Center for Climate Change, Korea Environment Institute, Sejong, 30147, South Korea; Lim C.-H., Department of Forestry, Environment, and Systems, Kookmin University, 77 Jeongneungro, Seongbukgu, Seoul, 02707, South Korea, College of General Education, Kookmin University, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul, Seongbukgu, 02707, South Korea",,,,,,,"C.-H.

Most existing studies have primarily focused on climatic and topographical factors, while this research expands the scope by employing a synergistic approach that integrates geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and machine learning (ML) methodologies for identifying and assessing forest fire-prone areas in the STR and their vulnerability to climate change. To achieve this, the study employed a comprehensive dataset of forty-four influencing factors, including topographic, climate-hydrologic, forest health, vegetation indices, radar features, and anthropogenic interference, into ten ML models: neural net (nnet), AdaBag, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBTree), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), and its hybrid variants with differential evolution algorithm (RF-DEA), Gravitational Based Search (RF-GBS), Grey Wolf Optimization (RF-GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (RF-PSO), and genetic algorithm (RF-GA). The study revealed high FFS in both the northern and southern portions of the study area, with the nnet and RF-PSO models demonstrating susceptibility percentages of 12.44% and 12.89%, respectively. Conversely, very low FFS zones consistently displayed susceptibility scores of approximately 23.41% and 18.57% for the nnet and RF-PSO models. The robust mapping methodology was validated by impressive AUROC (>0.88) and kappa coefficient (>0.62) scores across all ML validation metrics. Future climate models (ssp245 and ssp585, 2022–2100) indicated high FFS zones along the northern and southern edges of the STR, with the central zone categorized from low to very low susceptibility. Boruta analysis identified actual evapotranspiration (AET) and relative humidity as key factors influencing forest fire ignition. SHAP evaluation reinforced the influence of these factors on FFS, while also highlighting the significant role of distance to road, distance to settlement, dNBR, slope, and humidity in prediction accuracy.

We integrated remotely sensed data, climate records, and landscape features to identify the causes of variability in the time-to-recover of canopy leaf area in southeast Australian eucalypt forests. Approximately 97% of all observed burns between 2001 and 2014 recovered to a pre-fire leaf area index (±0.25 sd) within six years. Time-to-recover was highly variable within individual wildfires (ranging between ≤1 and ≥5 years), across burn seasons (90% longer January to September), and year of fire (median time-to-recover varying four-fold across fire years). We used the logistic growth function to estimate the leaf area recovery rate, burn severity, and the long-term carrying capacity of leaf area. Time-to-recover was most correlated with the leaf area recovery rate. The leaf area recovery rate was largest in areas that experienced high burn severity, and smallest in areas of intermediate to low burn severity. The leaf area recovery rate was also strongly accelerated by anomalously high post-fire precipitation, and delayed by post-fire drought. Finally we developed a predictive machine-learning model of time-to-recover (R2: 0.68). Despite the exceptionally high burn severity of the 2019–2020 Australian megafires, we forecast the time-to-recover to be only 15% longer than the average of previous fire years. © 2024 The Authors.

In this paper, the fire records in Shaanxi Province from 2010 to 2020 are utilized to construct a panel data model based on which two machine learning models including Random Forest (RF) model and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model are trained and used to analyze the relationship between socio-economic multivariate factors and fire incidence/fire risk level. The fire incidence is predicted based on regression analysis based on machine learning models, while the fire risk level is predicted based on the classification capability of machine learning models. The results show that both the optimal RF model and BPNN model perform well in the regression task, with R2 values to be 0.81 and 0.67, respectively; and can perform better in the prediction of fire risk level, with accuracy to be 91% and 91%, respectively. The results also reveal that socio-economic factors such as the population factors and economic factors could have the greatest importance for fire incidence prediction. This study demonstrates a significant correlation between fire incidence and socio-economic multivariate data, and also provides an important reference for regional fire risk assessment and fire incident prevention. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Fire incidence prediction; Knowledge mining and rule discovery; Machine learning methods; Panel data model,Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Prediction models; Fire incidence prediction; Fire risks; Knowledge mining; Knowledge mining and rule discovery; Knowledge rules; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Panel data models; Rule discovery; Socio-economics; Premixed flames,Springer,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211900599,Fire Technol.,"Joint International Research Laboratory of Catastrophe Simulation and Systemic Risk Governance, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China; School of National Safety and Emergency Management, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China; Faculty of Arts and Sciences/Leyu College, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China","Wang Y., Joint International Research Laboratory of Catastrophe Simulation and Systemic Risk Governance, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China, School of National Safety and Emergency Management, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China; Pan C., Joint International Research Laboratory of Catastrophe Simulation and Systemic Risk Governance, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China, School of National Safety and Emergency Management, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China; Ni X., Joint International Research Laboratory of Catastrophe Simulation and Systemic Risk Governance, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China, School of National Safety and Emergency Management, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China; Xue C., Faculty of Arts and Sciences/Leyu College, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China; Zhang J., Faculty of Arts and Sciences/Leyu College, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China; Hu J., Joint International Research Laboratory of Catastrophe Simulation and Systemic Risk Governance, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China, School of National Safety and Emergency Management, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, 519087, China",FITCA,,,,,,"X.

However, they face significant threats from Forest Fires (FFs), causing environmental damage and impacting wildlife and economies. The increasing global occurrence of FFs has created an urgent need for more accurate prediction methods. Traditional FF prediction approaches, reliant on meteorological data and human expertise, are often limited in accuracy and scalability. Deep Learning (DL) offers a promising solution for enhancing prediction capabilities. This systematic review evaluated various DL techniques for FF prediction, analyzing their methodologies, effectiveness, and challenges. Covering studies published between January 2017 and July 2024, 55 of 656 papers were selected for detailed analysis. The study revealed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are the most frequently used, with most datasets being publicly available. These findings indicate that classification models and simulation-based studies dominate the field. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Key meteorological features, such as Temperature, Humidity, and Wind speed, have been extensively studied using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the most commonly used satellite-derived features. However, integrating human activity data remains underexplored despite its potential to improve prediction accuracy significantly. Addressing this gap could enhance the practical applicability of DL models for FF predictions. This study provides insights into the most prevalent and effective DL techniques for FF prediction and highlights areas for future research.  © 2013 IEEE.",Deep learning; forest fire; forest fire prediction; prediction features; satellite images; wildfire,Convolutional neural networks; Fire hazards; Long short-term memory; Prediction models; Premixed flames; Deep learning; Ecological damage; Ecological resources; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Learning techniques; Prediction feature; Satellite images; Systematic Review; Wildfire; Forest ecology,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212126528,IEEE Access,"The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST), School of Computational and Communication Science and Engineering (CoCSE), Arusha, 2331, Tanzania","Mambile C., The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST), School of Computational and Communication Science and Engineering (CoCSE), Arusha, 2331, Tanzania; Kaijage S., The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST), School of Computational and Communication Science and Engineering (CoCSE), Arusha, 2331, Tanzania; Leo J., The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST), School of Computational and Communication Science and Engineering (CoCSE), Arusha, 2331, Tanzania",,,,,,,"C.

In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to predict forest fire susceptibility in Nainital district. Our innovative methodology integrates several robust models — AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost and Random Forest — with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a meta-model in a stacking framework. This approach not only utilises the individual strengths of these models, but also improves the overall prediction performance and reliability. By using XAI techniques, in particular SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), we improve the interpretability of the models and provide insights into the decision-making processes. Our results show the effectiveness of the ensemble model in categorising forest fire susceptibility into different zones: very low, low, moderate, high and very high. In particular, the stacking ensemble and XGBoost models identified extensive areas of high and very high susceptibility, with precision, recall and F1 values underpinning their effectiveness. These models achieved ROC AUC values above 0.90, with XGBoost performing exceptionally well with an AUC of 0.94. The precision, recall and F1 values for these models are remarkably high. The inclusion of confidence intervals for the most important metrics in all models emphasises their robustness and reliability and supports their practical use in forest fire management. Through SHAP summary plots, we analyze the global variable importance, revealing annual rainfall and Evapotranspiration (ET) as key factors influencing susceptibility. Local analysis using LIME consistently highlights the importance of annual rainfall, ET, and distance from roads across all models. This study fills an important research gap by providing a comprehensive and interpretable modelling approach that improves our ability to predict and effectively manage forest fire risk and is consistent with environmental protection and sustainable development goals. © 2024 The Authors",Ensemble modeling; Explainable artificial intelligence; Forest fire susceptibility; LIME; Nainital district,Decision making; Deep neural networks; Economics; Environmental protection; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning systems; Lime; Rain; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Annual rainfall; Ensemble models; Explainable artificial intelligence; F1 values; Forest fire susceptibility; Forest fires; Local interpretable model-agnostic explanation; Management strategies; Nainital district; Shapley; Deforestation,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192331491,Environ.

Early detection and swift action are crucial for controlling such situations and minimizing damage. However, the automatic tools based on local sensors in meteorological stations are often insufficient for detecting fires immediately. Machine learning offers a promising solution to forecast forest fires and reduce their rapid spread. In recent state-of-the-art solutions, only one or two techniques have been utilized for prediction. In this research, we investigate several methods for forest fire area prediction, including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Our aim is to identify the most effective and optimal method for predicting forest fires. After comparing our results with other artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques applied to the same dataset, we found that the LSTM approach outperforms the ARIMA and SVR predictors by more than 92%. Our findings also indicate that the LSTM algorithm has a lower estimation error when compared to other predictors, thus providing more accurate forecasts. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

Understanding the complex interactions between wildfires and their environmental and anthropogenic factors is crucial for effective wildfire modeling and management. Despite significant advancements in wildfire modeling using machine learning (ML) methods, their limited explainability remains a barrier to utilizing them for in-depth wildfire analysis. This paper employs Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models along with the MODIS global fire atlas dataset (2004–2020) to study the influence of meteorological, topographic, vegetation, and human factors on wildfire occurrences in the mountainous region of Southwest China. It also utilizes Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a method within explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to demonstrate the influence of key controlling factors on the frequency of fire occurrences. The results indicate that wildfires in this region are primarily influenced by meteorological conditions, particularly sunshine duration, relative humidity (seasonal and daily), seasonal precipitation, and daily land surface temperature. Among local variables, altitude, proximity to roads, railways, residential areas, and population density are significant factors. All models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities with AUC values over 0.8 and prediction accuracies ranging from 76.0% to 95.0%. XGBoost outperforms LR and RF in predictive accuracy across all factor groups (climatic, local, and combinations thereof). The inclusion of topographic factors and human activities enhances model optimization to some extent. SHAP results reveal critical features that significantly influence wildfire occurrences, and the thresholds of positive or negative changes, highlighting that relative humidity, rain-free days, and land use land cover changes (LULC) are primary contributors to frequent wildfires in this region. Based on regional differences in wildfire drivers, a wildfire-risk zoning map for the mountainous region of Southwest China is created. Areas identified as high risk are predominantly located in the Northwestern and Southern parts of the study area, particularly in Yanyuan and Miyi, while areas assessed as low risk are mainly distributed in the Northeastern region. © 2024 by the authors.",driving factor; explainable artificial intelligence; extreme gradient boosting; machine learning; prediction accuracy; random forest; wildfire,Adaptive boosting; Deforestation; Logistic regression; Population dynamics; Driving factors; Explainable artificial intelligence; Extreme gradient boosting; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Mountainous regions; Prediction accuracy; Random forests; Southwest China; Wildfire; Risk assessment,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206475630,Remote Sens.,"Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, Chengdu, 610041, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, College of Atmospheric Science, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Sichuan Provincial Climate Centre, Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 610072, China; Wenjiang National Climatic Observatory, Wenjiang District Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 611100, China; Sichuan Province Meteorological Disaster Defense Technology Center, Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 610072, China","Liu J., Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, Chengdu, 610041, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China, Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, College of Atmospheric Science, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China, Sichuan Provincial Climate Centre, Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 610072, China, Wenjiang National Climatic Observatory, Wenjiang District Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 611100, China; Wang Y., Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, Chengdu, 610041, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Lu Y., Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry of Water Resources, Chengdu, 610041, China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Zhao P., Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, College of Atmospheric Science, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Wang S., Sichuan Provincial Climate Centre, Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 610072, China; Sun Y., Sichuan Province Meteorological Disaster Defense Technology Center, Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 610072, China; Luo Y., Sichuan Provincial Climate Centre, Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Service, Chengdu, 610072, China",,,,,,,"Y.

Furthermore, the risk of forest fires is steadily increasing due to climate change. The most effective method for mitigating forest fire risk is proactive prevention before forest fires can occur by identifying high-risk areas based on land surface conditions. This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based forest fire diagnostic model designed for Republic of Korea, considering both satellite-derived land surface data and anthropogenic factors. For the remote sensing data, VTCI (Vegetation Temperature Condition Index) was used to reflect the land surface dryness. In addition, fire activity maps for buildings, roads and cropland were used to consider the influence of human activities. The forest fire diagnostic model yielded an accuracy of 0.89, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting forest fire risk. To validate the effectiveness of the model, 92 short-term forest fire risk forecast maps were generated from March to May 2023 with real-time data on forest fire occurrences collected for verification. The results showed that 73% of forest fires were accurately classified within high-risk zones, confirming the operational accuracy of the model. Through the forest fire diagnostic model, we have presented the impact relationships of meteorological, topographical, and environmental data, as well as the dryness index based on satellite images and anthropogenic factors, on forest fire occurrence. Additionally, we have demonstrated the potential uses of surface condition data. © 2024 by the authors.",diagnostic model; disaster risk reduction; forest fire; remote sensing,Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Remote Sensing; Water Management; Climate change; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Anthropogenic factors; Diagnostic model; Disaster risk reductions; Fire occurrences; Fire risks; Forest fires; Land surface; Model-based OPC; On-machines; Remote-sensing; climate change; disaster management; forest fire; forest management; land surface; machine learning; mitigation; remote sensing; risk assessment; Water conservation,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199661740,Forests,"Department of Environmental Science and Ecological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, South Korea; OJEong Resilience Institute (OJERI), Korea University, Seoul, 02841, South Korea","Roh M., Department of Environmental Science and Ecological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, South Korea; Lee S., Department of Environmental Science and Ecological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, South Korea; Jo H.-W., OJEong Resilience Institute (OJERI), Korea University, Seoul, 02841, South Korea; Lee W.-K., OJEong Resilience Institute (OJERI), Korea University, Seoul, 02841, South Korea",,,,,,,"W.-K.

If wildfires can be extinguished in a relatively short period of time after they occur, the losses caused by wildfires will be greatly reduced. Although deep learning methods have been shown to have powerful feature extraction capabilities, many current models still have poor generalization performance when faced with complex tasks. To this end, in this study, we considered introducing attention modules both inside and outside the nested U-shaped structure and trained a neural network model based on the U2-Net architecture to enable the model to suppress the activation of irrelevant areas. Compared with baseline models such as U-Net, our model has made great progress on the test set, with an F1 score improvement of at least 2.8%. The experimental results indicate that the model we proposed has certain practicality and can provide a significant scientific basis for forest fire management and emergency decision-making. © 2024 by the authors.",attention module; deep learning; U2-Net; wildfire spread,Activation; Decision Making; Ecosystems; Fires; Forests; Models; Neural Networks; Safety; Decision making; Deep learning; Fires; Neural networks; Attention mechanisms; Attention module; Deep learning; Economic development; Human lives; Learning methods; Property; Short periods; U2-net; Wildfire spread; artificial neural network; comparative study; experimental study; machine learning; prediction; wildfire; Premixed flames,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207526661,Forests,"College of Computer and Mathematics, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; School of Electronic Information, Central South University, Changsha, 410075, China","Xiao H., College of Computer and Mathematics, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China, School of Electronic Information, Central South University, Changsha, 410075, China; Zhu Y., College of Computer and Mathematics, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; Sun Y., College of Computer and Mathematics, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; Zhang G., College of Computer and Mathematics, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; Gong Z., College of Computer and Mathematics, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China",,,,,,,"Y.

To simulate fire dangers and fire spread behaviour, statistical techniques are applied to historical fire incidents. A number of fire-based data tables are used to create the Canadian fire weather index (FWI). FWI is a straightforward method that effectively identifies vegetation's fire vulnerability. Simple empirical equations are used to calculate the Australian fire danger index (FDI). Similar to FWI is FDI. Models for forest fires that combine stochastic and mathematical techniques accurately mimic the spread of the fire and forecast its severity. Physical models use heat transport through convection and radiation as well as the heat balance of sources (fire) and sinks (forest areas close to the fire source). MATLAB or Delphi programmes are used to solve the differential equations relating to heat transfer. The world crown fire modelling experiment's predicted fire spread behaviour closely matches the predictions made by mathematical approaches. In real-time forestry, forest landscape, wind speed, ambient temperature and rainfall level are obtained from satellite imagery and weather forecasting and machine learning is used for predicting the vulnerability to forest fire and the rate of spreading of the fire. © 2024 - Kalpana Corporation.",Cellular automata; Fire danger index; Fire vulnerability; Fire weather index; Forest fire; Physical model; Rate of spread,,Kalpana Corporation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212147057,Indian J.

A dataset for no-fire, medium confidence (MC) fire events, and high confidence (HC) fire events is constructed from MODIS-MOD14A2. Nine climate variables from NASA’s FLDAS are used as input variables, and 12 dates and 915 study points are considered. Three machine learning ensemble multi-label classifiers, gradient boosting (GBC), random forest (RFC), and extremely randomized tree (ETC), are used for forest fire simulation for the period 2000 to 2021, and ETC is found to be the most accurate classifier. Future fire projection for the near-future period of 2030 to 2050 is carried out with the ETC model, using CMIP6 EC-Earth3-SSP245 General Circulation Model (GCM) data. It is projected that MC forest fire occurrences will decrease, while HC forest fire occurrences will increase, and that the summer months, especially September, will be the most affected by fire. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Forecasting; Forest fire; General circulation model; Machine learning,Climate; Fires; Iran; Seasons; Wildfires; Golestan; Iran; Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Machine learning; NASA; Climate variables; Fire event; Fire occurrences; Forest fires; General circulation model; Golestan provinces; High confidence; Hyrcanian forests; Learning-based approach; Machine-learning; climate change; forecasting method; forest fire; general circulation model; machine learning; climate; fire; Iran; season; wildfire; Forecasting,Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185950757,Environ.

Furthermore, it is an uncontrollable disaster and poses a great deal of threat to human health and ecosystems. In Algeria, almost 40,000 hectares are burned each year, approximately 1% of all existing woodlands of the country. In this work, the forest fire event prediction is highlighted using machine learning. The study utilized data sets from several sources, including fire data obtained from the fire information system for resource management by NASA (FIRMS) and climate data accessed from the NASA energy project API, derived from the MODIS satellite (NASA forecasting of energy resources around the world). Fire data from NASA provides real-time information, spanning from 2000 to 2020. The methodology process of creating the prediction system involved collecting the data, preprocessing the data, finding the best models, training and testing the models, and evaluating them for validation. The machine learning model was trained and validated using 70% and 30% of the set features with a performance accuracy of up to 86%. Upon completion, we deployed our selected machine learning model to create a Web platform enables different end users to check possible future forest fires by select a geographical area on a world map. The objective of our machine learning model is to analyze the weather data of the selecting area on the map in real time and predict whether a fire will occur or not. This prediction system will enhance early detection, allowing prompt response measures to be implemented, reducing the risk of uncontrolled wildfires and safeguarding ecosystems and communities.

To predict and generate wildfire susceptibility maps to visualize the probability of wildfire occurrence intuitively, we propose a Clustering-based Resampling with the Cost-sensitive Boosting (CRCBoost) method. Emphasizing the highly cluster-able feature vectors in wildfire imbalance data overlooked by previous studies, CRCBoost adopts a clustering-based resampling strategy in each iteration of boosting and sets various misclassification costs for positive and negative samples to be more sensitive for identifying the fire points. Due to the frequent wildfires in two contract counties (Los Angeles and Ventura) in California, USA, they are set as the study area. Data regarding historical wildfires, geographical, meteorological, and vegetation features are collected for the period spanning 2010 to 2020. A recursive feature elimination algorithm is used for filtering out irrelevant features. CRCBoost is more suitable for short-term wildfire occurrence prediction and its performance is demonstrated to be better than other popular machine learning methods. Generating wildfire susceptibility maps and calculating feature importance are helpful to identify areas of high wildfire susceptibility and main drivers. Moreover, the findings can further assist in wildfire prevention, mitigation, and response. © 2023",Fire occurrence probability; Machine learning; Wildfire susceptibility,Adaptive boosting; Disasters; Economics; Fires; Iterative methods; Boosting method; Clusterings; Cost-sensitive; Fire occurrence probability; Machine-learning; Natural disasters; Novel clustering; Resampling; Susceptibility maps; Wildfire susceptibilities; Machine learning,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174577713,Reliab Eng Syst Saf,"School of Economics and Management, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China; Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610064, China","Wang N., School of Economics and Management, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China; Zhao S., School of Economics and Management, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China; Wang S., Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610064, China",RESSE,,,,,,"S.

Machine learning (ML) and remote sensing technologies are extensively integrated and employed as powerful tools for WSM. However, the intricate nature of ML algorithms often leads to ‘black box’ systems, obscuring the decision-making process and significantly limiting stakeholders' ability to comprehend the basis of predictions. This opacity hinders efforts to enhance performance and risks exacerbating overfitting. This present study proposes an innovative WSM approach that incorporates qualitative and quantitative feature selection techniques within the Explainable AI (XAI) framework. The methodology aims to enhance the precision of WSM and provide insights into the factors contributing to model decisions, thereby increasing the interpretability of predictions and streamlining models to improve performance. To achieve this objective, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-Forward Stepwise Selection (FSS) method to demonstrate its efficacy in elucidating the qualitative and quantitative impacts of predictors on ML algorithm performance, accuracy, and interpretability designed for WSM. Utilizing post-fire imagery from Sentinel-2 (S2), we analyzed ten bands to generate 225 unique spectral indices utilizing five different calculations: normalized, algebraic sum, difference, ratio, and product forms. Combined with the original S2 bands, this resulted in 235 potential predictors for ML classifications. A random forest model was subsequently developed using these predictors and optimized through extensive hyperparameter tuning, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.917 and a Kappa statistic of 0.896. The most influential predictors were identified using SHAP values, with an FSS process narrowing them down to the 12 most critical for effective WSM, as evidenced by stabilized OA and Kappa values (0.904 and 0.881, respectively). Further validation using a ninefold spatial cross-validation technique demonstrated the method's consistent performance across different data partitions, with OA values ranging from 0.705 to 0.894 and Kappa values from 0.607 to 0.867. By providing a more accurate and comprehensible XAI-based method for WSM, this research contributes to the broader field of environmental monitoring and disaster response, underscoring the potential of integrated qualitative and quantitative analysis to enhance ML models' capabilities. © 2024 The Author(s)",Forward stepwise selection; Machine learning; Sentinel-2; SHAP; Wildfire severity mapping,accuracy assessment; algorithm; environmental monitoring; machine learning; mapping method; precision agriculture; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; stakeholder; wildfire,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190329260,Ecol.

Humans cause 90% of them (negligence or provoked) and the behaviour of individuals is unpredictable. However, atmospheric and environmental variables affect the spread of wildfires, and they can be analysed by using deep learning. In order to mitigate the damage of these events, we proposed the novel Wildfire Assessment Model (WAM). Our aim is to anticipate the economic and ecological impact of a wildfire, assisting managers in resource allocation and decision-making for dangerous regions in Spain, Castilla y León and Andalucía. The WAM uses a residual-style convolutional network architecture to perform regression over atmospheric variables and the greenness index, computing necessary resources, the control and extinction time, and the expected burnt surface area. It is first pre-trained with self-supervision over 100,000 examples of unlabelled data with a masked patch prediction objective and fine-tuned using a very small dataset, composed of 445 samples. The pretraining allows the model to understand situations, outclassing baselines with a 1,4%, 3,7% and 9% improvement estimating human, heavy and aerial resources; 21% and 10,2% in expected extinction and control time; and 18,8% in expected burnt area. Using the WAM we provide an example assessment map of Castilla y León, visualizing the expected resources over an entire region. © 2023",Atmospheric variables; Autoencoder; Deep Learning; Few-shot learning; Fusion; Regression model; Wildfire risk assessment,Antennas; Damage detection; Decision making; Deep learning; Ecology; Fires; Image processing; Learning systems; Network architecture; Regression analysis; Assessment models; Atmospheric variables; Auto encoders; Deep learning; Few-shot learning; Regression modelling; Risks assessments; Wildfire assessment; Wildfire risk assessment; Wildfire risks; Risk assessment,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85177730238,Knowl Based Syst,"Computer Systems Department, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, Madrid, 28031, Spain; Signal Theory and Communications Department, Universidad de Alcalá, Plaza San Diego s/n, Alcalá de Henares, 28801, Spain; LATUV, Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universidad de Valladolid, Plaza de Santa Cruz, Valladolid, 47002, Spain","Liz-López H., Computer Systems Department, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, Madrid, 28031, Spain; Huertas-Tato J., Computer Systems Department, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, Madrid, 28031, Spain; Pérez-Aracil J., Signal Theory and Communications Department, Universidad de Alcalá, Plaza San Diego s/n, Alcalá de Henares, 28801, Spain; Casanova-Mateo C., Computer Systems Department, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, Madrid, 28031, Spain; Sanz-Justo J., LATUV, Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universidad de Valladolid, Plaza de Santa Cruz, Valladolid, 47002, Spain; Camacho D., Computer Systems Department, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Calle Alan Turing s/n, Madrid, 28031, Spain",KNSYE,,,,,,"H.

In the Central-South region of China, forest fires pose a significant threat to the ecological system, public safety, and economic stability. This study employs Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and the LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model to identify the determinants of forest fire incidents and develop a predictive model for the likelihood of forest fire occurrences, in addition to proposing a zoning strategy. The purpose of the study is to enhance our understanding of forest fire dynamics in the Central-South region of China and to provide actionable insights for mitigating the risks associated with such disasters. The findings reveal the following: (i) Spatially, fire incidents exhibit significant clustering and autocorrelation, highlighting areas with heightened likelihood. (ii) The Central-South Forest Fire Likelihood Prediction Model demonstrates high accuracy, reliability, and predictive capability, with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 85% and AUC values above 89%, proving its effectiveness in forecasting the likelihood of forest fires and differentiating between fire scenarios. (iii) The likelihood of forest fires in the Central-South region of China varies across regions and seasons, with increased likelihood observed from March to May in specific provinces due to various factors, including weather conditions and leaf litter accumulation. Risks of localized fires are noted from June to August and from September to November in different areas, while certain regions continue to face heightened likelihood from December to February. © 2024 by the authors.",central-south China; fire occurrence analytics; forest fires; GIS application; predictive modeling; seasonal fire patterns; spatial clustering analysis,Accuracy; China; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Forest Management; GIS; Patterns; China; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Geographic information systems; Predictive analytics; Central-south china; Clustering analysis; Fire occurrence analytic; Fire occurrences; Fire patterns; Forest fires; Geographic information system application; Information systems application; Predictive models; Seasonal fire pattern; South China; Spatial clustering; Spatial clustering analyse; cluster analysis; forest fire; GIS; machine learning; modeling; prediction; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; Fires,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194226873,Forests,"Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Department of Ecology and Environment, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China; Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Research Institute of Urban and Regional Development, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing & Geography Information System, Hohhot, 010022, China; College of Geographical Science, Inner Mongolia Normal University, Hohhot, 010022, China; Yellow River Jizi Bend Ecological Research Institute, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China","Hai Q., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Department of Ecology and Environment, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China, Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Han X., Department of Ecology and Environment, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China; Vandansambuu B., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Research Institute of Urban and Regional Development, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Bao Y., Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing & Geography Information System, Hohhot, 010022, China, College of Geographical Science, Inner Mongolia Normal University, Hohhot, 010022, China; Gantumur B., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Research Institute of Urban and Regional Development, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Bayarsaikhan S., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Research Institute of Urban and Regional Development, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Chantsal N., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Research Institute of Urban and Regional Development, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Sun H., Department of Ecology and Environment, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China, Yellow River Jizi Bend Ecological Research Institute, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China",,,,,,,"X.

This study focused on developing and evaluating machine learning (ML) models based on a dataset collected of outdoor experimental fires in Canadian conifer forests. Binary classification models (surface fire vs. crown fire) and multi-class fire type models (surface, passive crown, active crown) were created using ensemble tree methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) and automated ML (AutoGluon, TabPFN). Generative adversarial networks (GAN) were used to generate synthetic data to overcome imbalances in the type of fire distribution. The results show automated ML methods applied to the binary problem to perform best of all tested methods, with an overall accuracy of 91%. TabPFN had the highest accuracy for the multi-class problem, with the use of GAN improving model fit. Results show overfitting issues with some of the ML models, highlighting the need of independent evaluation when ML models are developed. The TabPFN models have potential for application in supporting fire management, namely in fuel management and identifying situations with high fire spread and intensity potential that can impact firefighter safety. © 2023",AutoGluon; Crown fire; Generative adversarial networks; Random Forest; TabPFN; Wildfire behaviour; XGBoost,accuracy assessment; classification; coniferous forest; experimental study; fire management; machine learning,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197061858,Ecol.

Despite the limited existing research on forest fires in this area, the application of machine learning and neural network techniques presents an opportunity to enhance forest fire prevention and control efforts. Utilizing data of forest fire from the SC Forestry Commission for the year 2023, prediction models were developed incorporating various factors such as meteorology, terrain, vegetation, and infrastructure—key drivers of forest fires in SC. Feature importance analysis was employed to construct the final fire prediction model using different machine learning and neural network approaches including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Correlation coefficients analysis was employed to construct the final fire hazard map using a correlation test. The evaluation of predictive performance based on accuracy scores revealed that the DT model achieved the highest accuracy of 90.58%, surpassing other models. However, based on the kernel density map of the fire data from 2000 to 2023, the correlation test gave the better fire hazard map compared to any other machine learning or neural network approach that utilized feature importance. Nonetheless, all models achieved prediction accuracies exceeding 80%. This finding directed us to the approach based on the correlation coefficients rather than to those just based on feature importance. The overlap between fire locations and carbon hotspots provided the immediate need to mitigate the carbon loss due to fire in those locations. These results serve as a valuable resource for forest fire prediction in SC, demonstrating the efficacy of the correlation test, providing a theoretical foundation and data support for future forestry applications in the region, and showing the outperforming capability of this method compared to other approaches based on feature importance and the importance to prioritize areas to mitigate the climate change impact based upon fire prediction. © 2024 by the authors.",ArcGIS Pro; fire; Google Earth Engine; machine learning; neural network,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196885473,Fire,"Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation, College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States","Sharma S., Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation, College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States; Khanal P., Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation, College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States",,,,,,,"S.

Forecast zoning the occurrence of these fires is crucial for timely and effective response measures. This study employs the random forest algorithm and geospatial analysis, including kernel density and standard deviation ellipse methods, to predict forest fire occurrences. Historical fire data analysis reveals noteworthy findings: (i) Decreasing Trend in Forest Fires: The annual forest fire count in the southern region exhibits a decreasing trend from 2001 to 2019, indicating a gradual reduction in fire incidence. Spatial autocorrelation in fire point distribution is notably observed. (ii) Excellent Performance of Prediction Model: The constructed forest fire prediction model demonstrates outstanding performance metrics, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, F1-scores, and AUC on the testing dataset. (iii) Seasonal Variations in High-Risk Areas: The probability of high-risk areas for forest fires in the southern region shows seasonal variations across different months. Notably, March to May sees increased risk in Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Fujian. June to August concentrates risk in Hunan and Jiangxi. September to November and December to February have distinct risk zones. These findings offer detailed insights into the seasonal variations of fire risk, providing a scientific basis for the prevention and control of forest fires in the southern region of China. © 2023 by the authors.",forest fire prediction; geospatial analysis; machine learning; prevention and control; southern China,China; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Performance; Seasonal Variation; Statistical Analysis; Variations; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Machine learning; Statistical tests; Zoning; Case-studies; Fire occurrences; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Geo-spatial analysis; High-risk areas; Machine-learning; Prevention and controls; Seasonal variation; Southern China; algorithm; forest fire; machine learning; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; zoning; Fires,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185841285,Forests,"Geomatics Engineering Department, Sichuan College of Architectural Technology, Deyang, 618000, China; Tianjin Centre of Geological Survey, China Geological Survey, Tianjin, 300170, China; Institute of Remote Sensing Satellite, China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, 100094, China; Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China; School of Geography, Development and Environment, The University of Arizona, Tucson, 85719, AZ, United States","Jing X., Geomatics Engineering Department, Sichuan College of Architectural Technology, Deyang, 618000, China; Li X., Tianjin Centre of Geological Survey, China Geological Survey, Tianjin, 300170, China; Zhang D., Institute of Remote Sensing Satellite, China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, 100094, China; Liu W., Institute of Remote Sensing Satellite, China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, 100094, China; Zhang W., Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China; Zhang Z., School of Geography, Development and Environment, The University of Arizona, Tucson, 85719, AZ, United States",,,,,,,"X.

These wildfires might be caused by humans or by natural causes. Wildfires are one of the factors contributing to the extinction of rare flora and wildlife that serve to maintain our planet's ecological balance. In this paper, a comparative analysis of various machine learning classifier models for predicting forest fires was undertaken using two separate datasets. The suggested system's processing is dependent on a few characteristics such as temperature, humidity, oxygen, and wind. Several machine learning classification techniques, including logistic regression, support vector classifier, decision tree, k neighbors and random forest, were used in this study. For further optimization of the model, K-fold cross validation method and hyperparameter tuning were implemented. The system reveals Support Vector Machine as the best strategy for the forest fire dataset, with 96.88% accuracy. Random Forest method was found to be the best for the Cortez and Morais dataset, with 90.24% accuracy. © 2024, Asian Research Association.

Traditional fire monitoring technologies like MODIS and VIIRS are often hindered by cloud cover and smoke. This study explores the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for fire monitoring in complex environments. By analyzing cumulative burned areas in southeastern Brazil, a new fire detection method combining GNSS-R with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is proposed to improve accuracy and response time. Results show high agreement between predicted and actual fire areas, with CNN outperforming Random Forest (RF) by 3.3% in prediction accuracy and achieving a 17.4% increase in model fitting. Error analysis indicates no systematic errors, with CNN exhibiting lower fire detection errors and better spatial alignment with actual conditions than RF, which tends to overestimate. This study provides a novel approach to fire detection using GNSS-R, with significant implications for fire prediction and management strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

We consider the dynamically changing characteristics of forest fires and the corresponding varying resource requirements. Based on this, this paper models a two-timescale UAV dynamic deployment scheme by considering the dynamic changes in the number and position of UAVs. In the slow timescale, we use a gate recurrent unit (GRU) to predict the number of future users and determine the number of UAVs based on the resource requirements. UAVs with low energy are replaced accordingly. In the fast timescale, a deep-reinforcement-learning-based UAV position deployment algorithm is designed to enable the low-latency processing of computational tasks by adjusting the UAV positions in real time to meet the ground devices’ computational demands. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better prediction accuracy. The number and position of UAVs can be adapted to resource demand changes and reduce task execution delays. © 2024 by the authors.",deep reinforcement learning; edge computing; forest fire; UAV,Antennas; Deep learning; Deforestation; Edge computing; Fire hazards; Fires; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Deep reinforcement learning; Dynamic deployment; Edge computing; Fire scenarios; Forest fires; Reinforcement learnings; Resource requirements; Time-scales; Unmanned aerial vehicle; algorithm; article; deep reinforcement learning; forest fire; prediction; simulation; unmanned aerial vehicle; Reinforcement learning,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85198460971,Sensors,"School of Communications and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China","Zuo W., School of Communications and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China; Xian Y., School of Communications and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China",,,,,,,"W.

Hotspots as indicators of forest fires capable of quickly monitoring large areas are often predicted using various machine learning methods. However, there is still few research that analyzes the sensitivity and feature importance of each predictor that forms a machine learning prediction model. This study evaluates and compares machine learning methods to predict hotspots in Kalimantan based on local and global climate factors in 2001-2020. Using the most accurate machine learning model, each climate factor used as a predictor is analyzed for its sensitivity and feature importance. Four methods used include random forest, gradient boosting, Bayesian regression, and artificial neural networks. Meanwhile, measures of sensitivity and feature importance used are variance, density, and distribution-based sensitivity indices, as well as permutation and Shapley feature importance. Evaluation of the machine learning model concluded that the Bayesian linear regression model outperformed other models with an RMSE of 750 hotspots and an explained variance score of 68.96% on testing data. Meanwhile, tree-based models show signs of overfitting, including gradient boosting and random forest. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis and feature importance of the Bayesian linear regression model, the number of dry days is the most important feature in predicting fire hotspots in Kalimantan. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Accurately assessing forest fire susceptibility is critical for effective environmental management. Supervised learning methods dominate this assessment, relying on a substantial dataset of forest fire occurrences for model training. However, obtaining precise forest fire location data remains challenging. To address this issue, semi-supervised learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging both a limited set of collected samples and unlabeled data containing environmental factors for training. Our study employed the transductive support vector machine (TSVM), a key semi-supervised learning method, to assess forest fire susceptibility in scenarios with limited samples. We conducted a comparative analysis, evaluating its performance against widely used supervised learning methods. The assessment area for forest fire susceptibility lies in Dayu County, Jiangxi Province, China, renowned for its vast forest cover and frequent fire incidents. We analyzed and generated maps depicting forest fire susceptibility, evaluating prediction accuracies for both supervised and semi-supervised learning methods across various small sample scenarios (e.g., 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 samples). Our findings indicate that TSVM exhibits superior prediction accuracy compared to supervised learning with limited samples, yielding more plausible forest fire susceptibility maps. For instance, at sample sizes of 4, 16, and 28, TSVM achieves prediction accuracies of approximately 0.8037, 0.9257, and 0.9583, respectively. In contrast, random forests, the top performers in supervised learning, demonstrate accuracies of approximately 0.7424, 0.8916, and 0.9431, respectively, for the same small sample sizes. Additionally, we discussed three key aspects: TSVM parameter configuration, the impact of unlabeled sample size, and performance within typical sample sizes. Our findings support semi-supervised learning as a promising approach compared to supervised learning for forest fire susceptibility assessment and mapping, particularly in scenarios with small sample sizes. © 2024",Forest fire; Limited sample; Semi-supervised learning; Spatial prediction; Supervised learning; Unlabeled data,China; Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; Supervised Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine; Wildfires; China; Jiangxi; Deforestation; Economics; Environmental management; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Forest fires; Limited sample; Prediction accuracy; Sample sizes; Semi-supervised learning; Small samples; Spatial prediction; Supervised learning methods; Transductive support vector machine; Unlabeled data; assessment method; forest cover; forest fire; supervised learning; support vector machine; Article; environmental factor; environmental management; forest fire; nonhuman; support vector machine; China; ecosystem; fire; forest; supervised machine learning; wildfire; Fires,Academic Press,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191191699,J.

Therefore, accurately and temporally estimating and mapping forest fire probability is necessary for preventing from destructive effects of forest fires. In this study, the forest fire occurrence in Southwestern Turkey was modeled and mapped with the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. We used past fire locations (from 2008 to 2018) with environmental variables such as fuel type, topography, meteorological parameters, and human activity for modeling and mapping, using data that could be obtained quickly and easily. The performances of fire occurrence models was quite satisfactory (AUC: range from 0.71 to 0.87) in terms of the model reliability. When the fire occurrence models were analyzed in detail, it was seen that the environmental variables with the highest gain when used alone were the maximum temperature, tree species composition, and distance to agricultural lands. To evaluate the models, we compared the fire locations between 2019 and 2020 with those on re-classified fire probability maps. Fire location from 2019-2020 fit substantially within the model fire occurrence predictions since many fire points in high or extreme fire probability categories has been observed. The results of this study can be a guideline for the Mediterranean forestry that has consistently struggled the forest fires and attempted to manage effectively forest lands at fire risk. © SISEF.",Fire Ignition; Fire Risk; Machine Learning; Maximum Entropy; Turkey,,SISEF - Italian Society of Silviculture and Forest Ecology,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85184729805,IForest,"Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Faculty of Forestry, Department of Forest Engineering, Istanbul, 34473, Turkey; Kastamonu University, Faculty of Forestry, Department of Forest Engineering, Kastamonu, 37100, Turkey","Göltaş M., Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Faculty of Forestry, Department of Forest Engineering, Istanbul, 34473, Turkey; Ayberk H., Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Faculty of Forestry, Department of Forest Engineering, Istanbul, 34473, Turkey; Kücük O., Kastamonu University, Faculty of Forestry, Department of Forest Engineering, Kastamonu, 37100, Turkey",,,,,,,"M.

With 81% of its terrain forested, Gangwon-do is particularly susceptible to wildfires, as evidenced by the fact that seven out of the ten most extensive wildfires in Korea have occurred in this region, with significant ecological and economic implications. Here, we analyze 480 historical wildfire occurrences in Gangwon-do between 2003 and 2019 using 17 predictor variables of wildfire occurrence. We utilized three machine learning algorithms—random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine—to construct wildfire susceptibility prediction models and identify the best-performing model for Gangwon-do. Forest and soil map data were integrated as important indicators of wildfire susceptibility and enhanced the precision of the three models in identifying areas at high risk of wildfires. Of the three models examined, the random forest model showed the best predictive performance, with an area-under-the-curve value of 0.936. The findings of this study, especially the maps generated by the models, are expected to offer important guidance to local governments in formulating effective management and conservation strategies. These strategies aim to ensure the sustainable preservation of forest resources and to enhance the well-being of communities situated in areas adjacent to forests. Furthermore, the outcomes of this study are anticipated to contribute to the safeguarding of forest resources and biodiversity and to the development of comprehensive plans for forest resource protection, biodiversity conservation, and environmental management.

As the wildland–urban interface expands, more people are exposed to and harmed by these extensive wildfires, which are also eroding the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems. With future wildfire activity expected to increase, there is an urgent demand for solutions that sustain healthy ecosystems and wildfire-resilient human communities. Those who manage disaster response, landscapes, and biodiversity rely on mapped projections of how fire activity may respond to climate change and other human factors. California wildfire is complex, however, and climate–fire relationships vary across the state. Given known geographical variability in drivers of fire activity, we asked whether the geographical extent of fire models used to create these projections may alter the interpretation of predictions. We compared models of fire occurrence spanning the entire state of California to models developed for individual ecoregions and then projected end-of-century future fire patterns under climate change scenarios. We trained a Maximum Entropy model with fire records and hydroclimatological variables from recent decades (1981 to 2010) as well as topographic and human infrastructure predictors. Results showed substantial variation in predictors of fire probability and mapped future projections of fire depending upon geographical extents of model boundaries.

Applications connected to the prediction, management, and recognition of wildfires are enhanced recently. But, with utilize of technical solutions including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and wireless sensor networks (WSN), it can be feasible for developing early-warning methods with appropriate accuracy. With important sensors to measure variations in wind speed, temperature, and humidity, as well as for detecting the occurrence of fire and smoke, is a suitable manner for accomplishing this task, based on our view. Imaging sensors in WSN are utilized for collecting data in the target environment and deep learning (DL) approaches for forest fire detection (FFD) observe the attained images. With this motivation, this study develops a new DL model for forest fire detection named, the FFDNet technique. The presented FFDNet technique uses an emperor penguin optimizer with machine learning for forest fire detection in WSN. The goal of the FFDNet technique is to identify the occurrence of forest wire using sensors in WSN and DL models. Primarily, the sensor nodes transmit the images to the BS where the actual classification process takes place. In the presented FFDNet technique, the guided filtering (GF) technique is employed for the noise removal process. Besides, the presented FFDNet technique exploits a modified Xception network for a feature extraction process with root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. For the detection process, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) model is used in this study and the EPO algorithm can optimally choose its parameters.

Wildfires are a type of disturbance that can affect many aspects of an ecosystem and its species. Therefore, through the integration of spatial models and species distribution models (SDMs), we can make informed predictions of the occurrence of such phenomena and their potential impacts. This study focused on five focal species, namely, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), wild sheep (Ovis orientalis), wildcat (Felis silvestris), and striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena). This study used MODIS active fire data and ensemble machine learning methods to model the risk of wildfire occurrence in 2023 for spring, summer, and autumn separately. This study also investigated the suitability of habitats for focal species via SDMs. The predicted probability maps for wildfire risk and habitat suitability were converted to binary values via the true skill statistic (TSS) threshold. The overlap of the habitat suitability map and wildfire occurrence areas was analyzed via GAP analysis. The area prone to fire in spring, summer and winter is equal to 9077.32; 10,199.83 and 13,723.49 KM2 were calculated, which indicates an increase in wildfire risk. Proximity to roads is one of the most important factors affecting the possible effects of wildfires in all seasons. Most fire occurrences are concentrated on agricultural lands, which, when integrated with other land use types, have wildfire potential in all seasons. The use of fire to destroy agricultural residues is a critical factor in the occurrence of wildfires. The distribution range of each focal species is considered the most important component of fire susceptibility. Hence, the suitable habitat for Hyaena hyaena in spring, summer, and autumn, with areas of 5.257, 5.856, and 6.889 km2 respectively, is the most affected by the possibility of fire. In contrast, these areas have the lowest values for Ovis orientalis, with 162, 127, and 396 km2 respectively. Therefore, species that are dependent on human-based ecosystems have the highest vulnerability to wildfire. Conservation efforts should focus on familiarizing farmers with methods of destroying agricultural residues as well as the consequences of intentional fires. The findings of this study can be used to mitigate the negative impacts of wildfire and protect the habitat of focal species. © 2024 Morovati, Karami.

In this paper, we leverage the capabilities of classification and fast prediction of machine learning and deep learning to detect forest fires by proposing a dual-stage approach of identification and segmentation of burnt/burning regions. The initial identification step uses simple classification by harnessing custom convolutional neural network and AlexNet to detect satellite images displaying signs of burning, followed by the next step of segmentation, which employs UNet and SegNet architectures to precisely localize the burnt/burning areas. We chose UNet considering its ability of efficient feature preservation, and SegNet prominent use for precise boundary delineation. For training our models, we have curated a dataset using Google Earth Engine, querying latitude, longitude, and dates. Image processing techniques facilitated the extraction of segmentation masks, bounding box images, and segmented images. The post-training results portray that CNN outperforms AlexNet with an 88.19% accuracy for classification, while in segmentation, UNet excelled over SegNet with a dice score of 0.6869. If deployed, this study stands to benefit forest officials, local communities, and biodiversity. Moreover, it aids afforestation teams in identifying burnt zones for targeted reforestation efforts, ensuring a more effective response to forest fires. © The Author(s) 2024.",AlexNet; Convolutional neural network; Landsat-8; SegNet; UNet; Wildfire,Biodiversity; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Image segmentation; Reforestation; Alexnet; Convolutional neural network; Detection system; Forest fires; LANDSAT; Landsat-8; Segnet; Unet; Wildfire; Wildfire detection; Landsat,Springer,Article,Article in press,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200320640,Multimedia Tools Appl,"Computer Science Department, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States; Computer Science Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States; Computer Engineering Department, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & amp; Engineering, NMIMS University, Maharashtra, Mumbai, India","Singh S., Computer Science Department, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States; Vazirani V., Computer Science Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States; Singhania S., Computer Engineering Department, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & amp; Engineering, NMIMS University, Maharashtra, Mumbai, India; Suroth V.S., Computer Engineering Department, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & amp; Engineering, NMIMS University, Maharashtra, Mumbai, India; Soni V., Computer Engineering Department, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & amp; Engineering, NMIMS University, Maharashtra, Mumbai, India; Biwalkar A., Computer Engineering Department, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & amp; Engineering, NMIMS University, Maharashtra, Mumbai, India; Krishnan D., Computer Engineering Department, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & amp; Engineering, NMIMS University, Maharashtra, Mumbai, India",MTAPF,,,,,,"S.

However, such analyses have traditionally been conducted at local or national scales, hindering cross-border comparisons and the formulation of broad-scale policy initiatives. In this study, we present an analysis of the spatial variability of wildfire initiations across Europe, focusing specifically on moderate to large fires (> 100 ha), and examining the influence of both human and climatic factors on initiation areas. We estimated drivers of fire initiation using machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), covering the majority of the European territory (referred to as the “ET scale”). The models were trained using data on fire initiations extracted from a satellite burned area product, comprising fires occurring from 2001 to 2019. We developed six RF models: three considering all fires larger than 100 ha, and three focused solely on the largest events (> 1000 ha). Models were developed using climatic and human predictors separately, as well as both types of predictors mixed together. We found that both climatic and mixed models demonstrated moderate predictive capacity, with AUC values ranging from 79 % to 81 %; while models based only on human variables have had poor predictive capacity (AUC of 60 %). Feature importance analysis, using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), allowed us to assess the primary drivers of wildfire initiations across the European Territory. Aridity and evapotranspiration had the strongest effect on fire initiation. Among human variables, population density and aging had considerable effects on fire initiation, the former with a strong effect in mixed models estimating large fires, while the latter had a more important role in the prediction of very large fires. Distance to roads and forest-agriculture interfaces were also relevant in some initiation models. A better understanding of drivers of main fire events should help designing European forest fire management strategies, particularly in the light of growing importance of climate change, as it would affect both fire severity and areas at risk. Factors of fire initiation should also be part of a comprehensive approach for fire risk assessment, reduction and adaption, contributing to more effective wildfire management and mitigation across the continent. © 2024 The Authors",Fire; Fire risk; Forest fires; Human factors; Ignition probability,Europe; Climate change; Deforestation; Factor analysis; Fire hazards; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Anthropogenic factors; Climatic factors; Complex roles; Fire initiation; Fire risks; Forest fires; Ignition probability; Mixed modeling; Predictive capacity; Scale analysis; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; aridity; climate change; evapotranspiration; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; risk assessment; spatial variation; wildfire; aging; agriculture; Aridity Index; Article; climate; climate change; controlled study; environmental parameters; Europe; evapotranspiration; fire; forest; forest fire; geographic distribution; human; human impact (environment); machine learning; population density; population research; prediction; probability; random forest; risk assessment; rural area; sensitivity analysis; Shapley Additive Explanation; spatial analysis; urban area; wildfire; article; burn patient; Europe; fire; fire protection; forest fire; learning algorithm; machine learning; probability; Fires,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85184000985,Sci.

This study integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) modules to develop a novel deep learning model called CNN-BiLSTM for near-real-time wildfire spread prediction to capture spatial and temporal patterns. This study uses the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire product and a wide range of environmental variables, including topography, land cover, temperature, NDVI, wind informaiton, precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff to train the CNN-BiLSTM model. A comprehensive exploration of parameter configurations and settings was conducted to optimize the model’s performance. The evaluation results and their comparison with benchmark models, such as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and CNN-LSTM models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the CNN-BiLSTM model with IoU of F1 Score of 0.58 and 0.73 for validation and training sets, respectively. This innovative approach offers a promising avenue for enhancing wildfire management efforts through its capacity for near-real-time prediction, marking a significant step forward in mitigating the impact of wildfires. © 2024 by the authors.",CNN-BiLSTM; convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; long short-term memory (LSTM); VIIRS; wildfire spread,Brain; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Fires; Forecasting; Learning systems; Soil moisture; Thermography (imaging); Topography; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory; Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Memory modeling; Near-real time; Visible infrared imaging radiometer suites; Wildfire spread; Long short-term memory,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191402832,Remote Sens.,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John’s, A1C 5S7, NL, Canada; C-CORE, St. John’s, A1B 3X5, NL, Canada","Marjani M., Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John’s, A1C 5S7, NL, Canada; Mahdianpari M., Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John’s, A1C 5S7, NL, Canada, C-CORE, St. John’s, A1B 3X5, NL, Canada; Mohammadimanesh F., C-CORE, St. John’s, A1B 3X5, NL, Canada",,,,,,,"M.

The specific areas within the Central Valley were Yosemite Valley, Sequoias, and Kings Canyon since these areas can be considered wildfire hotspots. This topic is relevant since California has seen an increase in wildfires with an increase in annual forest burned areas to +172 % from 1996 to 2021 (ABC 2024). The algorithms selected were based on previous research that conducted similar studies. From this research it is hypothesized that the best performing algorithm for predicting wildfires would be Random Forest. The novelty in this study stems from focusing on the specific areas mentioned above, which is where many wildfires have occurred throughout the years. The overall goal is to determine the best machine learning algorithm to predict wildfires in the Central Valley and take the results to improve upon wildfire prevention within these regions. The methods implemented included Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Networks. The dataset was gathered from the following satellite data which include MERRA-2 and USGS Landsat 8 along with fire history from 2012 to 2023 within these regions. Utilizing the dataset in the following two variations were a random split and a chronological split of training and testing sets. The best-performing algorithm using this dataset was Decision Trees at 550 maximum splits with an F1-Score of 0.689. The F1-Score ranges between 0 and 1 with a score of 0.7 or higher being deemed a good model to be used for predictions. The conclusion that could be determined from this result is that the randomized data has better predicting power over a chronologically split dataset. This can be seen in the confusion matrices for the chronological split dataset having zero true positive values in all the methods except for Naïve Bayes. Overall, the results show that Decision trees with a larger maximum split in the leaf nodes result in a more accurate prediction of whether a fire will occur within the given regions. The conclusion that can be made from this result is that Decision Trees can be a useful tool in predicting wildfires in California's Central Valley. The applications of this research would be the ability to use the information gained in this study to aid in optimizing resources in wildfire prevention within these areas. © 2024 The Authors",Decision trees; Machine learning; Naïve Bayes; Neural networks; Random forest; Wildfire prediction,California; United States; algorithm; artificial neural network; Landsat; machine learning; optimization; prediction; satellite data; wildfire,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185515422,Tree.

However, the widely used oxygen consumption method requires expensive equipment, incurring high costs. This study proposes a comprehensive framework based on machine learning to predict fire source heat release rate using temperature as input. Firstly, fire scenarios with different parameters in ISO9705 room were simulated using FDS software to obtain temperature at various locations, establishing a fire database. Then, two recursive feature elimination algorithms based on the Lasso and the Random Forest (RF) models were employed separately for feature selection, resulting in two different low-dimensional feature subsets and a control group. Finally, different feature subsets were input to analyse and compare the prediction performance on the heat release rate of three typical algorithms: linear regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and lightGBM. Results indicate that the LightGBM model trained with the feature subset selected by the recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the Random Forest model exhibits the best predictive performance, with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 23.89 kW and 15.49 kW respectively, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9916. This comprehensive framework based on machine learning demonstrates excellent predictive performance and is cost-effective, providing a new and effective approach for predicting fire source heat release rate. © 2024",Feature selection; Heat release rate (HRR); Machine learning; Recursive feature elimination (RFE); Regression prediction,Cost effectiveness; Feature Selection; Forecasting; Forestry; Mean square error; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Set theory; Feature subset; Features selection; Heat release; Heat release rate; Machine-learning; On-machines; Recursive feature elimination; Regression predictions; Release rate; Fires,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183953024,Case Stud.

Existing systems typically use fire danger indices to predict landscape flammability, based on meteorological forecasts alone, often using little or no direct information on land surface or vegetation state. Here, we use a vegetation characteristic model, weather forecasts and a data-driven machine learning approach to construct a global daily ∼9 km resolution Probability of Fire (PoF) model operating at multiple lead times. The PoF model outperforms existing indices, providing accurate forecasts of fire activity up to 10 days in advance, and in some cases up to 30 days. The model can also be used to investigate historical shifts in regional fire patterns. Furthermore, the underlying data driven approach allows PoF to be used for fire attribution, isolating key variables for specific fire events or for looking at the relationships between variables and fire occurrence. © 2024.

However, current research studies on forest fire warning systems often focus on extensive geographic areas like states, counties, and provinces. This approach lacks the precision and detail needed for predicting fires in smaller regions. To address this gap, we propose a Transformer-based time series forecasting model aimed at improving the accuracy of forest fire predictions in smaller areas. Our study focuses on Quanzhou County, Guilin City, Guangxi Province, China. We utilized time series data from 2021 to 2022, along with remote sensing images and ArcGIS technology, to identify various factors influencing forest fires in this region. We established a time series dataset containing twelve influencing factors, each labeled with forest fire occurrences. By integrating these data with the Transformer model, we generated forest fire danger level prediction maps for Quanzhou County. Our model’s performance is compared with other deep learning methods using metrics such as RMSE, and the results reveal that the proposed Transformer model achieves higher accuracy (ACC = 0.903, MAPE = 0.259, MAE = 0.053, RMSE = 0.389). This study demonstrates that the Transformer model effectively takes advantage of spatial background information and the periodicity of forest fire factors, significantly enhancing predictive accuracy. © 2024 by the authors.",deep learning; forest fire; prediction; transformer,Accuracy; Data; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Images; Remote Sensing; China; Fujian; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Guilin; Quanzhou; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Time series; Deep learning; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Forest resources; Network-sensing; Prediction-based; Remote sensing images; Times series; Transformer; Transformer modeling; forest fire; image processing; periodicity; prediction; remote sensing; time series analysis; Forecasting,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199647195,Forests,"College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Sports Training Academy, Nanjing Sport Institute, Nanjing, 210014, China","Cao Y., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Zhou X., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Yu Y., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Rao S., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Wu Y., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Li C., Sports Training Academy, Nanjing Sport Institute, Nanjing, 210014, China; Zhu Z., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China",,,,,,,"Z.

The forecast of fire danger is critically important to assist stakeholders to avoid and mitigate wildfire-induced hazards and losses to both human society and natural ecosystems. Currently, fire danger rating methods often focus on fire weather classification based on fixed thresholds, which has shortcomings in generalizability and robustness. Based on historical fire occurrence data and meteorological data of Northeastern China from 2004 to 2015, we proposed a forest fire danger rating classification and forecasting model by combining the advantages of the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) system and two machine learning models such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Random Forest (RF) model. The method is divided into two stages. The first stage is the LSTM-based FWI system indexes prediction. In the first stage, the future FWI system indexes are obtained through the LSTM-based prediction model, and the RMSE and MAE of the prediction results are calculated to verify the prediction performance of the model. The second stage is random forest-based fire danger rating prediction method. In the second stage, we use the random forest method to get the fire danger occurrence probability and present the fire danger rating classification scheme. Then we verify the reliability of the fire danger rating classification scheme by using the forest fire danger data in Qipan Mountain. Our method predicts two randomly selected future intervals, and the prediction accuracy is 87.5%. The experimental results show that our machine learning-based forest fire danger rating classification method can provide a new idea for forest fire danger warnings. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Canadian fire weather index; Fire danger forecasting; LSTM; Machine learning; Random forest,Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Meteorology; Weather forecasting; Canadian fire weather index; Fire danger; Fire danger forecasting; Fire danger rating; Fire weather index; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Random forests; Rating classifications; Weather index systems; Long short-term memory,Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160831234,Multimedia Tools Appl,"Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China; Big Data Research Center for Ecology and Environment, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, China","Chen Z., Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; Zhang C., Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; Li W., Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; Gao L., Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; Liu L., Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China; Fang L., Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, China, CAS Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, 110016, China, Big Data Research Center for Ecology and Environment, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, China; Zhang C., Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China",MTAPF,,,,,,"C.

Post wildland fire assessments suggest that this mechanism is one of the leading causes of home destruction in wildland urban interface (WUI) fires. However, the process of ember deposition and accumulation on and around houses remains poorly understood. Herein, we develop a deep learning (DL) model to analyze data from a series of ember-related wind tunnel experiments for a range of wind conditions and roof slopes. The developed model is designed to identify building roof regions where embers will remain in contact with the rooftop. Our results show that the DL model is capable of accurately predicting the position and fraction of the roof on which embers remain in place as a function of the wind speed, wind direction, roof slope, and location on the windward and leeward faces of the rooftop. The DL model was augmented with explainable AI (XAI) measures to examine the extent of the influence of these parameters on the rooftop ember coverage and potential ignition. © 2024 by the authors.",deep learning model; ember; rooftop; spot fire; wildfire prediction; wildland fire,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194247150,Fire,"Glenn Department of Civil Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States","Al-Bashiti M.K., Glenn Department of Civil Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States; Nguyen D., Glenn Department of Civil Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States; Naser M.Z., Glenn Department of Civil Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States; Kaye N.B., Glenn Department of Civil Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States",,,,,,,"N.B.

This requires models that are both accurate and easily understood. However, traditional machine learning models, which typically use preset parameters, are often inaccurate and hard to interpret. Therefore, this study introduces an enhanced approach using data from 2000 to 2019 in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of China, incorporating 18 driving factors. Bayesian optimization algorithms, i.e., the Gaussian Process (GP) and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) probabilistic proxy models, were used to optimize the hyperparameters for LightGBM, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), respectively. Finally, forest fire danger prediction models were constructed to draw forest fire danger maps, and the performance was compared between different models. In detail, the model's predictive performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, Balanced F Score (F1), and area under curve (AUC). The evaluation demonstrated that the TPE-LightGBM exhibited remarkable accuracy (AUC = 0.962). The forest fire danger map categorizes the study area into five danger levels. The TPE-LightGBM effectively classifies 62.58% of the study area as low-danger level and 5.33% as high-danger Level V. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) model interpretation of TPE-LightGBM highlights daily the average relative humidity, sunshine hours, elevation, daily average air pressure, and daily maximum ground surface temperature as the primary influential factors, followed by the human activity indexed by the gross domestic product (GDP) and the distance to the nearest railway. © The Author(s).",,,Maximum Academic Press,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213843864,Emerg.

The purpose of prediction is to draw valid conclusions and provide useful advices in environmental management. Robust approach is often desirable when there exist outliers. Robust nonparametric regression methods have attracted much attention from a practical point of view. As a nonparametric Bayesian approach, Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provides a flexible regression that captures potential nonlinear relationships and complex interactions via the framework including sum-of-trees model, regularization prior and Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm (hereafter backfitting MCMC). When outliers are present in the data, we find out that BART has the highest prediction performance in simulation studies which are carried out in a variety of cases, compared to the well-known machine learning methods: random forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting. The findings of this study demonstrate that BART approach is seen to be remarkably robust to outliers. For illustration, we also analyze two datasets which exist many underlying outliers: one from a study of forest fires related factors and the other from a study of biomass fuels. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Bayesian additive regression trees; Bayesian nonparametric; Forecasting; Machine learning; Robust regression,Adaptive boosting; Additives; Bayesian networks; Deforestation; Environmental management; Fires; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Statistics; Support vector machines; Backfitting; Bayesian additive regression trees; Bayesian nonparametrics; Environmental data; Environmental model; Machine-learning; Model-based OPC; Non-parametric regression; Robust approaches; Robust regressions; additive; Bayesian analysis; computer simulation; machine learning; numerical model; regression analysis; support vector machine; Forecasting,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169933250,Environ.

Most detection methods are labor-intensive, lack speed for early detection, or result in high infrastructure costs. An essential approach to mitigating this issue involves establishing an efficient forest fire warning system based on amalgamating diverse available data sources and optimized algorithms. This research endeavors to develop a binary machine-learning classifier based on Thailand's forest fire occurrences from January 2019 to October 2022 using data acquired from satellite resources, including the Google Earth engine. We use four gas variables including carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The study explores a range of classification models, encompassing linear classifiers, gradient-boosting classifiers, and artificial neural networks. The XGBoost model is the top-performing option across various classification evaluation metrics. The model provides the accuracy of 99.6 % and ROC-AUC score of 0.939. These findings underscore the necessity for a comprehensive forest fire warning system that integrates gas measurement sensor devices and geospatial data. A feedback mechanism is also imperative to enable model retraining post-deployment, thereby diminishing reliance on geospatial attributes. Moreover, given that decision-tree-based algorithms consistently yield superior results, future research in machine learning for forest fire prediction should prioritize these approaches. © 2024 The Authors",Forest fire; Machine learning; Thailand; Warning system,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197488130,Heliyon,"International School of Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand; Disaster and Risk Management Information Systems Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand; Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand; Graduate School of System Design and Management, Keio University Collaboration Complex, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Kohoku-ku, Kanagawa, Yokohama, 223-8526, Japan; Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, 10330, Thailand","Tang J., International School of Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand, Disaster and Risk Management Information Systems Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand; Weeramongkolkul M., International School of Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand; Suwankesawong S., Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand; Saengtabtim K., Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand; Leelawat N., Disaster and Risk Management Information Systems Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand, Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand, Graduate School of System Design and Management, Keio University Collaboration Complex, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Kohoku-ku, Kanagawa, Yokohama, 223-8526, Japan; Wongwailikhit K., Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai, Pathumwan, 10330, Thailand",,,,,,,"N.

There is an urgent need to study the growth rate of fire-burned areas to fill the research gap in this region. To address this issue, this study uses the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters in the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, constructing a GWO-XGBoost model. Finally, the optimized ensemble model (GWO-XGBoost) is used to create a fire growth rate warning map for the Liangshan Prefecture in Sichuan Province, China, filling the research gap in forest fire studies in this area. This study comprehensively selects factors such as monthly climate, monthly vegetation, terrain, and socio–economic aspects and incorporates monthly reanalysis data from forest fire assessment systems in Canada, the United States, and Australia as features to construct the forest fire dataset. After collinearity tests to filter redundant features and Pearson correlation analysis to explore features related to the burned area growth rate, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to oversample the positive class samples. The GWO algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters in the XGBoost model, constructing the GWO-XGBoost model, which is then compared with XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) models. Model evaluation results showed that the GWO-XGBoost model, with an AUC value of 0.8927, is the best-performing model. Using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis method to quantify the contribution of each influencing factor indicates that the Ignition Component (IC) value from the United States National Fire Danger Rating System contributes the most, followed by the average monthly temperature and the population density. The growth rate warning map results indicate that the southern part of the study area is the key fire prevention area. © 2024 by the authors.",fire growth rate; forest fire prediction; GWO-XGBoost; machine learning,Area; Deforestation; Fire Fighting; Forest Fires; Growth Rate; Maps; Research; Safety Equipment; United States; Australia; Canada; China; Liangshan; Sichuan; United States; Deforestation; Fire extinguishers; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Population statistics; Area growths; Burned areas; Fire growth rates; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Gray wolf optimizer-xgboost; Gray wolves; Machine-learning; Optimizers; Research gaps; algorithm; climate conditions; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; population density; prediction; Premixed flames,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204934967,Forests,"College of Information Science and Technology & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China","Zhang L., College of Information Science and Technology & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Shi C., College of Information Science and Technology & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Zhang F., College of Information Science and Technology & Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China",,,,,,,"F.

This study examines the intensity and impacts of Chilgoza (Pinus gerardiana) Pine Forest fires by using advanced remote sensing techniques comprising Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) analyses based on Landsat 9 datasets. The study highlights the severe effect of these fires, resulting in noteworthy losses of livestock and private properties and widespread damage to 10,156.53 acres of the Chilgoza Pine Forest. A comprehensive variable correlation analysis is conducted to gain deeper insights into the influencing factors causing forest fires. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient was used to assess the association between burnt and unburnt areas and various independent factors. The analysis reveals compelling evidence of significant correlations with forest fire prevalence. This study found moderate negative (-0.532, p < 0.05) and positive (0.513, p < 0.05) correlations with elevation and Land Surface Temperature (LST), respectively, and a weak positive correlation (0.252, p < 0.05) with a Wind Speed (V). To predict forest fire susceptibility and better understand the contributing factors, three machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and logistic regression, are applied to assess variable importance scores. Among the considered factors, LST is the most critical variable, with consistently high variable importance scores (100 %, 96 %, and 59 %) across all three models. Wind Speed (V) also proved influential in all models, with variable importance scores of 78 %, 83 %, and 61 % for RF, XGBoost, and logistic regression, respectively. Moreover, elevation significantly influences the frequency of forest fires, as evidenced by variable importance scores ranging from 26 % to 100 %. Comparatively, the Random Forest model outperforms XGBoost and Logistic Regression in predicting forest fire vulnerability. During the training stage, the Random Forest (RF) model achieves an impressive classification accuracy of 99.1 %, followed by XGBoost with 94.5 % and Logistic Regression with 85.6 %. On evaluation with the validation dataset, the accuracies remain promising, with RF at 96.4 %, XGBoost at 91.1 %, and Logistic Regression at 84.6 %. Based on the Random Forest model, the identified high-risk sites offer valuable insights for proactive fire management and prevention strategies. This study provides a robust predictive model and a comprehensive understanding of forest fire severity and impacts. Future research should consider climate change scenarios and account for human activities to enhance fire behavior predictions and risk assessment models. © 2024 The Author(s)",Difference normalized burn ratio; Fire risk assessment; Forest fires; Machine learning; Predictive modeling,fire management; forest fire; livestock; pine; remote sensing; risk assessment; vulnerability,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186490987,Tree.

This complexity presents an immense challenge in predicting the course of forest fire spread. Traditional methods of forest fire spread prediction are constrained by their ability to process multidimensional fire-related data, particularly in the integration of spatiotemporal information. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of forest fire spread prediction, we proposed the AutoST-Net model. This innovative encoder–decoder architecture combines a three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) with a transformer to effectively capture the dynamic local and global spatiotemporal features of forest fire spread. The model also features a specially designed attention mechanism that works to increase predictive precision. Additionally, to effectively guide the firefighting work in the southwestern forest regions of China, we constructed a forest fire spread dataset, including forest fire status, weather conditions, terrain features, and vegetation status based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Himawari-8 satellite. On this dataset, compared to the CNN-LSTM combined model, AutoST-Net exhibits performance improvements of 5.06% in MIou and 6.29% in F1-score. These results demonstrate the superior performance of AutoST-Net in the task of forest fire spread prediction from remote sensing images. © 2024 by the authors.",attention mechanism; deep learning; forest fire spread; GEE; Himawari-8 satellite; prediction; spatiotemporal features,Deforestation; Disasters; Forest Fires; Performance; Remote Sensing; China; Convolutional neural networks; Deforestation; Disasters; Fire hazards; Fires; Long short-term memory; Remote sensing; Space optics; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Forest fire spread; Forest fires; Google earth engine; Google earths; Himawari-8 satellite; Performance; Remote sensing data; Spatiotemporal feature; artificial neural network; forest fire; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; Forecasting,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191402364,Forests,"School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; State Key Laboratory of Efficient Production of Forest Resources, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; School of Ecology and Nature Conservation, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China","Chen X., School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Tian Y., School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Zheng C., School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China, State Key Laboratory of Efficient Production of Forest Resources, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Liu X., School of Ecology and Nature Conservation, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China",,,,,,,"C.

To address these issues, we propose a novel algorithm, squeeze-excitation spatial multi-scale transformer learning (SESMTML), which is designed to extract multi-scale fire danger features from remote sensing images. SESMTML includes several key modules: the multi-scale deep feature extraction module (MSDFEM) captures global visual and multi-scale convolutional features, the multi-scale fire danger perception module (MFDPM) explores contextual relationships, the multi-scale information aggregation module (MIAM) aggregates correlations of multi-level fire danger features, and the fire danger level fusion module (FDLFM) integrates the contributions of global and multi-level features for predicting forest fire danger. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s significant superiority, achieving an accuracy of 83.18%, representing a 22.58% improvement over previous models and outperforming many widely used deep learning methods. Additionally, a detailed forest fire danger prediction map was generated using a test study area at the junction of the Miyun and Pinggu districts in Beijing, further confirming the model’s effectiveness. SESMTML shows strong potential for practical application in forest fire danger prediction and offers new insights for future research utilizing remote sensing images. © 2024 by the authors.",danger assessment; forest fire; multi-step algorithm; neural network; remote sensing,Application; Forest Fires; Images; Maps; Models; Perception; Remote Sensing; Test Methods; Deep learning; Fire hazards; Prediction models; Danger assessments; Danger prediction; Fire danger; Forest fires; Multi-scales; Multi-step algorithm; Multisteps; Neural-networks; Remote-sensing; Step algorithms; algorithm; artificial neural network; forest fire; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; risk assessment; Premixed flames,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205041036,Forests,"Key Laboratory of Ethnic Language Intelligent Analysis and Security Governance of MOE, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; School of Information Engineering, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China","Yang J., Key Laboratory of Ethnic Language Intelligent Analysis and Security Governance of MOE, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China, School of Information Engineering, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Jiang H., Key Laboratory of Ethnic Language Intelligent Analysis and Security Governance of MOE, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China, School of Information Engineering, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Wang S., Key Laboratory of Ethnic Language Intelligent Analysis and Security Governance of MOE, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China, School of Information Engineering, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China; Ma X., Key Laboratory of Ethnic Language Intelligent Analysis and Security Governance of MOE, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China, School of Information Engineering, Minzu University of China, Beijing, 100081, China",,,,,,,"H.

In this study, we proposed an interpretable and accurate hybrid machine learning (ML) model, that explicitly represented the controls of fuel flammability, fuel availability, and human suppression effects on fires. The model demonstrated notable accuracy with a F1-score of 0.846 ± 0.012, surpassing process-driven fire danger indices and four commonly used ML models by up to 40% and 9%, respectively. More importantly, the ML model showed remarkably higher interpretability relative to other ML models. Specifically, by demystifying the “black box” of each ML model using the explainable AI techniques, we identified substantial structural differences across ML fire models, even among those with similar accuracy. The relationships between fires and their drivers, identified by our model, were aligned closer with established fire physical principles. The ML structural discrepancy led to diverse fire predictions and our model predictions exhibited greater consistency with actual fire occurrence. With the highly interpretable and accurate model, we revealed the strong compound effects from multiple climate variables related to evaporative demand, energy release component, temperature, and wind speed, on the dynamics of large fires and megafires in the western US. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the structural integrity of models in addition to their accuracy. They also underscore the critical need to address the rise in compound climate extremes linked to large wildfires. © 2024 American Family Insurance and The Author(s).

This study employs advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to comprehensively analyze the factors driving the occurrence of these fire events. A predictive model for forest fire occurrences has been developed, complemented by targeted zoning management strategies. The key findings are as follows: (i) Spatial analysis reveals substantial clustering and spatial autocorrelation of fire points, indicating high-density areas of forest fire occurrence, primarily in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, as well as the northeastern region. This underscores the need for tailored fire prevention and management approaches. (ii) The forest fire prediction model for the central region demonstrates exceptional accuracy, reliability, and predictive power. It achieves outstanding performance metrics in both training and validation sets, with an accuracy of 86.00%, precision of 88.00%, recall of 87.00%, F1 score of 87.50%, and an AUC value of 90.50%. (iii) Throughout the year, the occurrence of forest fires in central China varies by location and season. Low-occurrence periods are observed in summer and winter, particularly in Hunan and Hubei provinces, due to moderate weather conditions, agricultural practices, and reduced outdoor activities. However, spring and autumn also present localized risks due to uneven rainfall and dry climates. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of forest fire occurrences in central China, offering a solid framework for proactive fire management and policy formulation to effectively mitigate the impacts of these events. © 2024 by the authors.",autocorrelation; central China; convolutional neural network (CNN); forest fires; geographic information system (GIS); prediction accuracy,Accuracy; Analysis; China; Forest Fires; Health; Management; Safety; Stability; China; Hubei; Hunan; Jiangxi; Fire hazards; Forest ecology; Health risks; Premixed flames; Public risks; Auto correlation; Central chinas; Convolutional neural network; Fire occurrences; Forest fires; Geographic information; Geographic information system; Prediction accuracy; Spatial analysis; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; autocorrelation; forecasting method; forest fire; GIS; machine learning; prediction; spatial analysis; Convolutional neural networks,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202694621,Forests,"Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 14200, Mongolia; Department of Railway Engineering, Baotou Railway Vocational and Technical College, Baotou, 014060, China; Department of Ecology and Environment, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China; Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Research Institute of Urban and Regional Development, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 14200, Mongolia","Guo Y., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 14200, Mongolia, Department of Railway Engineering, Baotou Railway Vocational and Technical College, Baotou, 014060, China; Hai Q., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 14200, Mongolia, Department of Ecology and Environment, Baotou Teacher’s College, Baotou, 014030, China, Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia; Bayarsaikhan S., Department of Geography, School of Arts and Sciences, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 14200, Mongolia, Laboratory of Geoinformatics (GEO-iLAB), Graduate School, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, 14200, Mongolia, Research Institute of Urban and Regional Development, National University of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 14200, Mongolia",,,,,,,"Q.

We develop a novel machine learning model to predict post-fire burn severity using pre-fire remotely sensed data. Hydrological, ecological, and topographical variables collected from four regions of California — the site of the Kincade fire (2019), the CZU Lightning Complex fire (2020), the Windy fire (2021), and the KNP Fire (2021) — are used as predictors of the differenced normalized burn ratio. We hypothesize that a Super Learner (SL) algorithm that accounts for spatial autocorrelation using Vecchia’s Gaussian approximation will accurately model burn severity. We use a cross-validation study to show that the spatial SL model can predict burn severity with reasonable classification accuracy, including high burn severity events. After fitting and verifying the performance of the SL model, we use interpretable machine learning tools to determine the main drivers of severe burn damage, including greenness, elevation, and fire weather variables. These findings provide actionable insights that enable communities to strategize interventions, such as early fire detection systems, pre-fire season vegetation clearing activities, and resource allocation during emergency responses. When implemented, this model has the potential to minimize the loss of human life, property, resources, and ecosystems in California. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Ensemble prediction; Kriging; Machine learning; Remote sensing,California; United States; algorithm; kriging; machine learning; modeling; prediction; remote sensing; vegetation; wildfire,Springer,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188334673,Environ.

Many Americans, especially those living in Western states, have reported frequent drought and wildfire conditions, leading to an increased need for a modeling program to assess wildfire risk at a low computational cost. The research objective of this article was to develop a machine-learning model capable of producing the accurate wildfire risk assessments using five geospatial datasets: Land fire mean return, annual precipitation, Sentinel-2 imagery, land cover, and moisture deficit and surplus. To create the model, three separate machine-learning architectures were implemented (U-Net, DeepLabV3, and the pyramid scene parsing network) and then applied to the study area of San Bernardino County, CA, for the year of 2020.

Machine learning (ML) techniques have gained widespread use for forest fire susceptibility mapping due to their potent nonlinear learning capabilities. However, prior research has devoted insufficient attention to negative sample sampling, leading to overestimated fire susceptibility. Furthermore, the dynamic factors used for fire prediction are often extracted based on fixed time windows (FTW), making it challenging to accurately capture the spatial heterogeneity in forest cumulative dryness status (CDS). In this paper, we introduced a space-humidity-constrained (SHC-based) sampling method to generate negative samples with specific humidity. It was achieved by imposing distance and aridity constraints on randomly generated points, thus enhancing their representativeness. We also proposed a dynamic factor extraction method based on dynamic time windows (DTW), constrained by daily or cumulative precipitation thresholds (Thcp), to obtain fine-grained forest CDS information by limiting the statistical time windows of dynamic factors. Our results demonstrated that the forest fire susceptibility modeling approach, incorporating the above two methods for sample sets and feature sets construction, significantly enhanced the prediction performance of three ML models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), underscoring its stability and robustness in improving model performance. The RF model outperformed the SVM and MLP models in terms of both performance improvement and prediction accuracy. The application of these two proposed methods improved the prediction accuracy of the RF model by more than 3% (FTW of at least 35 days) and 5% (Thcp of at least 40 mm), respectively. As Thcp increased, the performance enhancement became even more pronounced (accuracy can increase by over 8% when Thcp is 60 mm). The novel modeling approach, rooted in an understanding of the mechanisms underlying forest fires and adeptly capturing the forest spatially heterogeneous CDS information, can significantly improve the mapping accuracy. Moreover, coupled with the adaptive acquisition advantage of dynamic factors, this study is able to generate near real-time fire susceptibility maps, which hold greater practical value for aiding decision-makers in formulating effective prevention and management strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Cumulative dryness status; Dataset representativeness; Dynamic time windows; Forest fire susceptibility mapping; Machine learning; Performance improvement; Precipitation-constrained,Decision Making; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Mapping; China; Decision making; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mapping; Support vector machines; Cumulative dryness status; Dataset representativeness; Dynamic time; Dynamic time window; Forest fire susceptibility mapping; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Performance; Performance improvement; Precipitation-constrained; Susceptibility mapping; Time windows; extraction method; forest fire; forest management; heterogeneity; machine learning; support vector machine; Fires,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186540801,For.

This study places its focus on wildfires in two regions of Alberta, Fort McMurray and Slave Lake, in Southwest Canada. For the simulation of wildfire spread, an adapted fire propagation model was employed, incorporating MODIS datasets such as land surface temperature, land cover, land use, and integrated climate data. The pixels were classified as burned or unburned in relation to the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire and the initial 16 days of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, utilizing defined starting points and the aforementioned specified datasets. The simulation for the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire achieved an weighted average precision, recall, and f1-scores of 0.989, 0.986, and 0.987, respectively. Additionally, macro-averaged scores across these three phases were 0.735, 0.829, and 0.774 for precision, recall, and F1-scores, respectively. The simulation of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire introduced a phased analysis, dividing the initial 16 days into three distinct periods. This approach led to average precision, recall, and f1-scores of 0.958, 0.933, and 0.942 across these phases. Additionally, macro-averaged scores across these three phases were 0.681, 0.772, and 0.710 for precision, recall, and F1-scores, respectively. The strategy of segmenting simulations into phases may enhance adaptability to dynamic factors like weather conditions and firefighting strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

The eastern region of China is particularly susceptible to frequent forest fires, characterized by high population density and vibrant economic activities. Precise forecasting in this area is essential for devising effective prevention strategies. This research utilizes a blend of kernel density analysis, autocorrelation analysis, and the standard deviation ellipse method, augmented by geographic information systems (GISs) and deep-learning techniques, to develop an accurate prediction system for forest-fire occurrences. The deep-learning model incorporates data on meteorological conditions, topography, vegetation, infrastructure, and socio-cultural factors to produce monthly forecasts and assessments. This approach enables the identification of spatial patterns and temporal trends in fire occurrences, enhancing both the precision and breadth of the predictions. The results show that global and local autocorrelation analyses reveal high-incidence areas mainly concentrated in Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces, with cities like Jiangmen exhibiting distinct concentration characteristics and a varied spatial distribution of fire occurrences. Kernel density analysis further pinpoints high-density fire zones primarily in Meizhou, Qingyuan, and Jiangmen in Guangdong Province, and Dongfang City in Hainan Province. Standard deviation ellipse and centroid shift analysis indicate a significant northward shift in the fire-occurrence centroid over the past 20 years, with an expanding spatial distribution range, decreasing flattening, and relatively stable fire-occurrence direction. The model performs effectively on the validation set, achieving an accuracy of 80.6%, an F1 score of 81.6%, and an AUC of 88.2%, demonstrating its practical applicability. Moreover, monthly fire zoning analysis reveals that high-incidence areas in spring and winter are mainly concentrated in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hainan, while autumn shows widespread medium-incidence areas, and summer presents lower fire occurrences in most regions. These findings illustrate the influence of seasonal climate variations on fire occurrences and highlight the necessity for enhanced fire monitoring and prevention measures tailored to different seasons. © 2024 by the authors.",deep learning; East China forest fires; forest-fire prediction; GIS integration; kernel density estimation; spatial distribution,Analysis; China; Density; Distribution; Errors; Forest Fires; Patterns; Standards; China; Guangdong; Jiangmen; Meizhou; Qingyuan; Autocorrelation; Forest ecology; Population statistics; Premixed flames; Deep learning; East China; East china forest fire; Fire occurrences; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Geographic information; Geographic information system integration; Information systems integration; Kernel Density Estimation; autocorrelation; forest fire; GIS; machine learning; prediction; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; Fire hazards,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205078112,Forests,"Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Innovation and Utilization, Zhejiang Institute of Subtropical Crops, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wenzhou, 325005, China; School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; School of Surveying and Geoinformation Engineering, East China University of Technology, Nanchang, 330013, China; Key Laboratory of Mine Environmental Monitoring and Improving around Poyang Lake of Ministry of Natural Resources, East China University of Technology, Nanchang, 330013, China; Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; School of Geographical Sciences, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150028, China; Tianjin Centre of Geological Survey, China Geological Survey, Tianjin, 300170, China","Li J., Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Innovation and Utilization, Zhejiang Institute of Subtropical Crops, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wenzhou, 325005, China, School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; Huang D., School of Surveying and Geoinformation Engineering, East China University of Technology, Nanchang, 330013, China, Key Laboratory of Mine Environmental Monitoring and Improving around Poyang Lake of Ministry of Natural Resources, East China University of Technology, Nanchang, 330013, China; Chen C., School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; Liu Y., Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Innovation and Utilization, Zhejiang Institute of Subtropical Crops, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wenzhou, 325005, China; Wang J., Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Resource Plant Innovation and Utilization, Zhejiang Institute of Subtropical Crops, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wenzhou, 325005, China; Shao Y., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Wang A., School of Geographical Sciences, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150028, China; Li X., Tianjin Centre of Geological Survey, China Geological Survey, Tianjin, 300170, China",,,,,,,"D.

Addressing FF in tropical ecosystems has become a priority to mitigate impacts on biodiversity loss and climate change. The escalating frequency and intensity of FF globally have become a mounting concern. Understanding their tendencies, patterns, and vulnerabilities is imperative for conserving ecosystems and facilitating the development of effective prevention and management strategies. This study investigates the trends, patterns, and spatiotemporal distribution of FF for the period of 2001–2022, and delineates the forest fire susceptibility zones in Odisha State, India. The study utilized: (a) MODIS imagery to examine active fire point data; (b) Kernel density tools; (c) FF risk prediction using two machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF); (d) Receiver Operating Characteristic and Area Under the Curve, along with various evaluation metrics; and (e) a total of 19 factors, including three topographical, seven climatic, four biophysical, and five anthropogenic, to create a map indicating areas vulnerable to FF. The validation results revealed that the RF model achieved a precision exceeding 94 % on the validation datasets, while the SVM model reached 89 %. The estimated forest fire susceptibility zones using RF and SVM techniques indicated that 20.14 % and 16.72 % of the area, respectively, fall under the “Very High Forest Fire” susceptibility class. Trend analysis reveals a general upward trend in forest fire occurrences (R2 = 0.59), with a notable increase after 2015, peaking in 2021. Notably, Angul district was identified as the most affected area, documenting the highest number of forest fire incidents over the past 22 years. Additionally, forest fire mitigation plans have been developed by drawing insights from forest fire management strategies implemented in various countries worldwide. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and forest management authorities to develop effective strategies for forest fire prevention and mitigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Climate and anthropogenic factors; Machine learning; Spatiotemporal trends; Susceptibility map; Wildfire management,India; Odisha; Biodiversity; Climate change; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Tropics; Anthropogenic factors; Climate factors; Fire mitigation; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Management strategies; Random forests; Spatiotemporal trends; Susceptibility maps; Wildfire management; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; efficiency measurement; fire management; forest fire; hazard management; machine learning; mitigation; model validation; MODIS; policy making; prediction; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; support vector machine; topographic effect; tropical forest; wildfire; area under the curve; Article; biodiversity; climate change; decision tree; diagnostic test accuracy study; environmental factor; forest fire; forest management; geographic distribution; human; learning algorithm; machine learning; mitigation; nonhuman; prediction; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sea surface temperature; seasonal rain forest; sensitivity and specificity; spatial analysis; species distribution; article; benchmarking; climate; controlled study; diagnosis; female; fire; fire protection; forest management; human impact (environment); male; Odisha; prevention; random forest; satellite imagery; support vector machine; vulnerability; wildfire; Ecosystems,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188927524,Sci.

Neural Network is a well-known and leading model where ML is being practiced. Recently, ML has become one of the influence tools in medical, medicine, agriculture, environment, and wildfire applications. Thus, making it exceptional when deciphering various problems. This paper has reviewed the implementation of ML techniques in wildfire incidence because it is a very complex process and it very essential to have knowledge, understanding, and awareness for handling it. In this paper, the overview of ML is generally described while the chosen and popular ML method among wild applications since 1990 are defined in detail. The use of the ML methods in wildfire applications is analysed into four categories, which are Fire Detection, Fire Mapping, Fire Occurrence Prediction, and Fire Susceptibility Mapping. Overall, about 109 related publications are identified within the study area and are located all around the world using numerous ML methods consisting of Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Networks (BN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Nevertheless, expertise in ML and wildfire science are essential to provide a good and realistic result along the process of modelling ML. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

However, in the Federal District, wildfire hazards have risen due to wildfires reaching several of its protected areas. Wildfire occurrence/incidence risk refers to the likelihood or probability of a wildfire event occurring in a particular geographic area. The risk is typically determined by factors such as weather conditions, topography, vegetation, and human activities and often measured through analyses of historical wildfire data and predictive models that estimate the likelihood of future wildfire events. High wildfire occurrence/incidence risk areas are those more likely to experience a wildfire incident, whereas low-risk ones are less susceptible to it. This study compares 8 machine learning models that predict wildfire occurrence risk worldwide so that they can be adopted in Brazil. They considered correlations among climate conditions, spatial location, topographic features, anthropogenic explanatory features, and fire occurrence and a dataset enriched with Brazilian governmental open data was comprised of observations on 16 climate features of 5 monitoring stations and satellite data on fires occurred over the past two decades and topographic, hydrographic, and anthropogenic features, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), urbanization index, and distance to rivers/roads. According to the results, fire risk can be predicted with 0.99 accuracy and the models showed more sensitive to NDVI, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity, as demonstrated by a study on the impact of features. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Classification; Fires; Machine learning; Prediction; Risk; Wildfires,Brazil; Federal District [Brazil]; anthropogenic effect; climate classification; climate conditions; machine learning; NDVI; risk assessment; spatial analysis; topographic effect; urbanization; wildfire,Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168892066,Enviro.

Machine learning, due to its powerful non-linear modeling capabilities, has been widely applied in forest fire risk prediction research. However, existing studies often focus on the direct information provided by multiple environmental factor features when constructing the feature space, while overlooking the deeper information conveyed by feature cross-correlations. Additionally, fire risk prediction predominantly relies on single-model forecasting, exhibiting slightly insufficient generalization and stability in models. Model fusion algorithms (MFA) can combine the advantages of multiple models to compensate for this limitation. In this study, a machine learning framework, FC-StackGNB, combining feature crosses (FC) and model fusion, is proposed. This framework employs the FC method to analyze the temporal trends of various environmental factors influencing fire occurrence, constructing multiple seasonal cross features (SCFs) capable of effectively capturing the non-linear relationship between environmental factors and time. Moreover, the framework develops a Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) optimized stacking MFA to fully leverage the strengths of different ML algorithms. Results demonstrate that the introduction of SCFs effectively enhances the prediction performance of six machine learning models, with the mean values of five evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC_AUC) increasing by 1.58% to 6.30%. The fusion model constructed based on the StackGNB algorithm can effectively handle the multicollinearity issue of features, exhibiting significantly better prediction performance than single models, particularly in improving the Recall metric (increasing by around 3% and 5% compared to the top two ranked single models respectively), which signifies the model's ability to predict positive samples (i.e., high-risk fire areas). The proposed modeling framework effectively enhances the robustness and prediction performance of the models, offering new modeling insights for subsequent research. This study holds significant importance for enhancing the level of forest fire risk warning. © 2024 The Authors",Environmental factors; FC-StackGNB; Feature crosses; Forest fire risk; Machine learning; Model fusion,Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Prediction models; Premixed flames; Environmental factors; Feature cross; Feature cross-stackgnb; Fire risks; Forest fire risk; Forest fires; Fusion algorithms; Machine-learning; Model fusion; Risk predictions; algorithm; environmental factor; environmental modeling; forest fire; machine learning; prediction; Forest ecology,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204099295,Ecol.

Furthermore, because environmental Web services have, now, access to a wider range of environmental data sources, services might be functionally similar but of varying quality. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-driven framework for service composition that is based on a layered architecture. Based on these layers, the proposed framework aims to select the optimal service instances participating in a service composition schema, through a modular ontology to infer the quality of data sources (QoDS) and an outranking approach. Moreover, it aims to executing the service composition schema at runtime by dynamically readjusting both the service composition schema and the service instances via a machine learning-based service composition approach. The conducted experiments showed that the proposed framework enables (i) a reasonable reasoning time for assessing the data sources’ quality, (ii) a decrease in the ELECTRE III MCDM method’s execution time achieved by combining the skyline and α-dominance methods, (iii) dynamic generation of the most relevant service composition schema with the appropriate wildfire risk classes, and (iv) a high prediction accuracy using our proposed outranking approach compared to the randomly selected services. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Dynamic service composition; Knowledge-driven approach; Machine learning (ML); Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM),Decision making; Fires; Machine learning; Quality of service; Risk assessment; Web services; Data-source; Dynamic services composition; Knowledge-driven approach; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-criteria decision making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Services composition; Forecasting,Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152290895,Cluster Comput.,"MIRACL Laboratory, FSEG Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University, CNRS, LIRIS UMR5205, University of Lyon, Lyon, France; InnoRenew CoE, University of Primorska, Koper, Slovenia; Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University, CNRS, LIRIS UMR5205, iaelyon school of Management, University of Lyon, Lyon, France; Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University, iaelyon school of Management, CNRS, INSA Lyon, UCBL, LIRIS, UMR5205, F-69008, University of Lyon, Lyon, France","Taktak H., MIRACL Laboratory, FSEG Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia, Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University, CNRS, LIRIS UMR5205, University of Lyon, Lyon, France; Boukadi K., MIRACL Laboratory, FSEG Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; Zouari F., InnoRenew CoE, University of Primorska, Koper, Slovenia; Ghedira Guégan C., Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University, CNRS, LIRIS UMR5205, iaelyon school of Management, University of Lyon, Lyon, France; Mrissa M., Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University, iaelyon school of Management, CNRS, INSA Lyon, UCBL, LIRIS, UMR5205, F-69008, University of Lyon, Lyon, France; Gargouri F., MIRACL Laboratory, FSEG Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia",,,,,,,"H.

Accurate quantitative prediction of forest fire spread is essential for devising swift risk management strategies and implementing effective firefighting approaches. In response to this imperative, this study introduces a Forest Fire Spread Behavior Prediction (FFSBP) model, encompassing two integral components: the Forest Fire Spread Process Prediction (FFSPP) model and the Forest Fire Spread Results Prediction (FFSRP) model. The FFSPP model involves the prediction of the direction and speed of forest fire spread, achieved through a fusion of the Cellular Automata model and the Wang Zhengfei model. On the other hand, the FFSRP model focuses on forecasting the extent of the burned area, leveraging machine learning methods. To validate the efficacy of the proposed models, a real case study is undertaken using the '3.29 Forest Fire' incident in China. The FFSPP model is validated against this case, while the FFSRP model is assessed using a real fire dataset obtained from Montesinho National Forest Park in Portugal. Results from the validation process reveal that during the natural development period of the '3.29 Forest Fire,' the FFSPP model predicts a burned area of 286.81 hm2, with an associated relative error of 28.94%. This relative error is notably smaller than those observed in the Farsite and Prometheus fire behavior simulation models. Additionally, the FFSRP model demonstrates commendable predictive performance, particularly in the context of small and medium-sized fire scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of the FFSBP model as a valuable tool in enhancing forest fire prediction accuracy and facilitating more robust risk mitigation and firefighting strategies.  © 2013 IEEE.",cellular automata; Forest fire prediction; forest fire spread; machine learning; Wang Zhengfei model,Artificial intelligence; Biological systems; Cellular automata; Deforestation; Disasters; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Learning systems; Risk management; Biological system modeling; Cellular automatons; Computational modelling; Forest fire prediction; Forest fire spread; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Predictive models; Wang zhengfei model; Fires,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190749996,IEEE Access,"China Academy of Building Research, Beijing, 100029, China; Xinjiang Institute of Technology, Xinjiang, 830099, China; Fire Rescue Detachment, Tongzhou, Beijing, 101100, China; Binzhou Safety Science and Technology Service Center, Binzhou, 256600, China; University of Science and Technology Beijing, School of Civil and Resource Engineering, Beijing, 100083, China; King Saud University, College of Sciences, Riyadh, 11362, Saudi Arabia","Sun X., China Academy of Building Research, Beijing, 100029, China; Li N., Xinjiang Institute of Technology, Xinjiang, 830099, China; Chen D., Fire Rescue Detachment, Tongzhou, Beijing, 101100, China; Chen G., China Academy of Building Research, Beijing, 100029, China; Sun C., China Academy of Building Research, Beijing, 100029, China; Shi M., Binzhou Safety Science and Technology Service Center, Binzhou, 256600, China; Gao X., University of Science and Technology Beijing, School of Civil and Resource Engineering, Beijing, 100083, China; Wang K., University of Science and Technology Beijing, School of Civil and Resource Engineering, Beijing, 100083, China; Hezam I.M., King Saud University, College of Sciences, Riyadh, 11362, Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,"N.

This favored the occurrence of natural disasters and led to the 2020 Pantanal fire crisis. The purpose of this work was to map the burned area’s extent during this crisis in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal biome using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The classification of the burned areas was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) in the Google Earth Engine platform. Input variables in the algorithm were the percentiles 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 of monthly (July to December) mosaics of the shade fraction, NDVI, and NBR images derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images. The results showed an overall accuracy of 95.9% and an estimate of 44,998 km2 burned in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal, which resulted in severe ecosystem destruction and biodiversity loss in this biome. The burned area estimated in this work was higher than those estimated by the MCD64A1 (35,837 km2), Fire_cci (36,017 km2), GABAM (14,307 km2), and MapBiomas Fogo (23,372 km2) burned area products, which presented lower accuracies. These differences can be explained by the distinct datasets and methods used to obtain those estimates. The proposed approach based on Sentinel-2 images can potentially refine the burned area’s estimation at a regional scale and, consequently, improve the estimate of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning, where global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale. Our study brings to light the necessity of developing approaches that aim to improve data and theory about the impacts of fire in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal, in order to improve Earth systems models that forecast wetland–atmosphere interactions, and the role of these fires on current and future climate change over these regions. © 2023 by the authors.",burned area; NBR; NDVI; Pantanal; Sentinel-2; shade fraction; wetland,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166228292,Fire,"Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division, National Institute for Space Research, São José dos Campos, 12227-010, Brazil; Department of Earth Sciences, University of South Alabama, Mobile, 36688, AL, United States; Department of Geosciences, Federal University of São João del-Rei, São João del-Rei, 36307-352, Brazil; Department of Geography, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 05508-000, Brazil; Graduate Program in Geography, Federal University of São João del-Rei, São João del-Rei, 36301-360, Brazil","Shimabukuro Y.E., Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division, National Institute for Space Research, São José dos Campos, 12227-010, Brazil; de Oliveira G., Department of Earth Sciences, University of South Alabama, Mobile, 36688, AL, United States; Pereira G., Department of Geosciences, Federal University of São João del-Rei, São João del-Rei, 36307-352, Brazil, Department of Geography, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 05508-000, Brazil; Arai E., Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division, National Institute for Space Research, São José dos Campos, 12227-010, Brazil; Cardozo F., Graduate Program in Geography, Federal University of São João del-Rei, São João del-Rei, 36301-360, Brazil; Dutra A.C., Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division, National Institute for Space Research, São José dos Campos, 12227-010, Brazil; Mataveli G., Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division, National Institute for Space Research, São José dos Campos, 12227-010, Brazil",,,,,,,"Y.E.

Deep learning methods have the potential to model the wildfire spread despite problems such as continuous time prediction and multimodal environmental encoding. Therefore, we present a novel hierarchical convolutional neural network (CNN) denoted as WFNet to model the spread pattern of wildfires. The core of WFNet is defining the spread spatiotemporal distribution field (SSDF) to describe the process of wildfire spread, enabling global optimization and end-to-end prediction. Then, a hierarchical State-Condition mechanism is implemented to progressively and efficiently encode high-order features pertaining to multimodal elements. The experimental results demonstrate that WFNet has a competitive performance to existing models in computation time and model accuracy. More interestingly, WFNet shows excellent robustness when input fire state is in an uncertain moment, enabling investigators to quickly backward the ignition from the fire perimeter. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Spatiotemporal distribution field; State-condition mechanism; Wildfire spread model,Continuous time systems; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Fires; Global optimization; Learning systems; Spatial distribution; Condition; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Multi-modal; Pattern analysis; Spatiotemporal distribution field; Spatiotemporal distributions; State-condition mechanism; Wildfire spread model; artificial neural network; disaster management; natural disaster; optimization; wildfire; Forecasting,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173064892,Environ.

Therefore, identifying and predicting the fire susceptible areas is crucial for managing protected area networks. In this study, we investigated the factors affecting forest fires and modelled the fire susceptibility in a human-dominated landscape in the central Western Ghats, India, by employing remote sensing, geographic information systems and machine learning techniques. We used six machine learning models (MLMs), including artificial neural network, random forest, generalized linear model, maximum entropy, multivariate adaptive regression splines, gradient boosting machine and the ensemble model, to relate the occurrence data of fires to 14 predictor variables categorized as climate, topography, vegetation, and anthropogenic disturbances to generate fire susceptibility maps. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC), true skill statistic (TSS) curves, accuracy and continuous Boyce index (CBI) were used to assess the model's accuracy. We found that all models achieved acceptable performance while validating the independent test data. However, ensemble model had the best overall performance with an AUC-ROC = 0.93; TSS = 0.72; ACCURACY = 0.89; and CBI = 0.95. The land-use and land-cover, and the distance to the agricultural fields and settlements were the key determinants of fire occurrences in the study area based on the ensemble model. The results showed that the landscape has a high to very high fire risk for about 26.5% of the total area. Forest fires have mostly occurred in the northeastern regions of the landscape, which are dominated by deciduous forests and plantations, whereas western regions are less susceptible to fires. Finally, we developed an ensemble-based fire susceptibility map with a resolution of 10 m that may be used as a tool for the prevention of forest fires. Further, it aids the relevant authorities in mitigating the disastrous effects and safeguarding the environment. The results demonstrated that ensemble-based MLMs can be employed effectively for fire prediction in other regions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Biomod2; blockCV; Ensemble model; Forest fire susceptibility modeling; Geospatial analysis; Tropical forest; Wildfires,Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Forecasts; Land Use; Neural Networks; India; Western Ghats; Biodiversity; Climate models; Conservation; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Land use; Machine learning; Neural networks; Topography; Tropics; Biomod2; Blockcv; Ensemble models; Forest fire susceptibility modeling; Forest fires; Geo-spatial analysis; Machine learning models; Tropical forest; Western ghats; Wildfire; biodiversity; forest fire; GIS; image resolution; landscape; machine learning; management; prediction; protected area; regression; risk; Fires,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85154606385,For.

Predicting wildfires with a model driven by wildfire danger factors can significantly reduce losses. Weather conditions continuously influence the drying rate of fuel as well as the occurrence probability and danger degree of wildfires. Previous studies have paid little attention to the continuous effects of weather and fuel on wildfires. This study improved the accuracy and effect of wildfire danger assessment using the time series features of weather and fuel. First, the time series features of weather and fuel factors within the 16 days before the fire were analyzed. Then, four feature groups were selected—feature group without time series values, feature group with time series values, feature group with Tsfresh transformation of time series values, and feature group with gradient and cumulative transformation of time series values—and three models were trained, respectively: random forest, balanced random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. The results showed that the f1-score of all feature groups with time series values (0.93) increased by 0.15, on average, compared with those without time series values (0.78) for the three models. The feature group with gradient and cumulative features had a more stable prediction accuracy and a more accurate wildfire danger map. The results suggest that using the appropriate time series features of weather and fuel can help improve the precision and effect of the wildfire danger assessment model. © 2023 by the authors.",machine learning; the Great Xing’an Mountain region; time series feature; weather and fuel factors; wildfire danger assessment,Accuracy; Fires; Forestry; Fuels; Gradient; Models; Safety; Weather; China; Da Hinggan Mountains; Fires; Forestry; Time series; Danger assessments; Feature groups; Machine-learning; Mountain regions; The great xing’an mountain region; Three models; Time series features; Times series; Weather and fuel factor; Wildfire danger assessment; assessment method; fuel; machine learning; time series analysis; weather; wildfire; Machine learning,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160711260,Forests,"School of Resources and Environment, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 611731, China","Wang Z., School of Resources and Environment, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 611731, China; He B., School of Resources and Environment, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 611731, China; Chen R., School of Resources and Environment, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 611731, China; Fan C., School of Resources and Environment, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 611731, China",,,,,,,"B.

In this study, wildfire susceptible areas were determined in the provinces of Muğla, Antalya, Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye, and Hatay in the Mediterranean region (Turkey). Within the scope of this purpose, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) methods, the most widely used deep learning techniques in the literature in recent years, were preferred to create Wildfire susceptibility models. Seventeen environmental variables were used in the analyses, and these variables were grouped as topographic factors, anthropological and environmental factors, climatic factors, and vegetation factors. In addition, the number of fire inventory data has been balanced with the help of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) used to increase the model result performance of the scarce inventory data. In the maps obtained by CNN and MLP methods, 17% and 28% of the study area were determined as high and very high susceptible areas, respectively. The results demonstrated that the CNN model had superior performance in Wildfire susceptibility assessment with accuracy (%85.8), precision (%98.7), sensitivity (%85.5), F- Score (%91.6), and ROC curve (%78.6). This model was followed by the MLP model with slightly lower accuracy values, which indicates that the CNN models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the MLP models. Finally, the wildfire susceptibility maps produced by deep learning methods could aid decision-makers and government organizations in the Mediterranean region in preventing future natural disasters. © 2023",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Mediterranean region; Multilayer perceptron; Susceptibility mapping; Wildfire,Decision Making; Disasters; Fires; Maps; Mediterranean; Methods; Models; Multilayers; Adana [Turkey]; Antalya [Turkey]; Hatay; Mediterranean Region; Mersin [Turkey]; Mugla; Osmaniye; Turkey; Climate change; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep learning; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Fires; Learning systems; Multilayers; Neural network models; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Inventory data; Mediterranean region; Multilayers perceptrons; Natural disasters; Susceptibility mapping; Susceptibility maps; Wildfire; Wildfire susceptibilities; anthropogenic effect; artificial neural network; inventory; mapping; prediction; topographic effect; wildfire; Multilayer neural networks,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156185998,For.

Therefore, assessing regional wildfire susceptibility is crucial for the early prevention of wildfires and formulation of disaster management decisions. However, current research on wildfire susceptibility primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of models, while lacking in-depth study of the causes and mechanisms of wildfires, as well as the impact and losses they cause to the ecological environment and urban development. This situation not only increases the uncertainty of model predictions but also greatly reduces the specificity and practical significance of the models. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to analyze the spatial distribution of wildfire susceptibility and the effects of influencing factors, while assessing the risks of wildfire damage to the local ecological environment and urban development. In this study, we used wildfire information from the period 2013–2022 and data from 17 susceptibility factors in the city of Guilin as the basis, and utilized eight machine learning algorithms, namely logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), to assess wildfire susceptibility. By evaluating multiple indicators, we obtained the optimal model and used the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to explain the effects of the factors and the decision-making mechanism of the model. In addition, we collected and calculated corresponding indicators, with the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) representing ecological vulnerability and the Night-Time Lights Index (NTLI) representing urban development vulnerability. The coupling results of the two represent the comprehensive vulnerability of the ecology and city. Finally, by integrating wildfire susceptibility and vulnerability information, we assessed the risk of wildfire disasters in Guilin to reveal the overall distribution characteristics of wildfire disaster risk in Guilin. The results show that the AUC values of the eight models range from 0.809 to 0.927, with accuracy values ranging from 0.735 to 0.863 and RMSE values ranging from 0.327 to 0.423. Taking into account all the performance indicators, the XGBoost model provides the best results, with AUC, accuracy, and RMSE values of 0.927, 0.863, and 0.327, respectively. This indicates that the XGBoost model has the best predictive performance. The high-susceptibility areas are located in the central, northeast, south, and southwest regions of the study area. The factors of temperature, soil type, land use, distance to roads, and slope have the most significant impact on wildfire susceptibility. Based on the results of the ecological vulnerability and urban development vulnerability assessments, potential wildfire risk areas can be identified and assessed comprehensively and reasonably. The research results of this article not only can improve the specificity and practical significance of wildfire prediction models but also provide important reference for the prevention and response of wildfires. © 2023 by the authors.",ecological environment; machine learning; risk assessment; SHAP; urban development; wildfire susceptibility,Backpropagation; Decision trees; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Ecology; Fires; Geographic information systems; K-means clustering; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Urban growth; Ecological environments; Ecological vulnerability; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Multisource data; Risks assessments; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Urban development; Wildfire susceptibilities; Risk assessment,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160619492,Remote Sens.,"College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Spatial Information and Geomatics, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China","Yue W., College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China; Ren C., College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Spatial Information and Geomatics, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China; Liang Y., College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Spatial Information and Geomatics, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China; Liang J., College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China; Lin X., College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China; Yin A., College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China; Wei Z., College of Geomatics and Geoinformation, Guilin University of Technology, 319 Yanshan Street, Guilin, 541006, China",,,,,,,"C.

Both areas are in the tropics which experience rainy and dry seasons annually. The long dry season such as in 2019 triggered forest and land fires in Borneo and Sumatra, causing haze disasters in the exposed areas. This indicates that climate variables play a role in burning forests and land in Borneo and Sumatra, but how climate affects the fires in both areas is still questionable. This study investigates the climate variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed in relation to the fire’s characteristics in Borneo and Sumatra. We use the Random Forest model to determine the characteristics of forest fires in Sumatra and Borneo based on the climate variables and carbon emission levels. According to the model, the fire event in Sumatra is slightly better predicted than in Borneo, indicating a climate-fire dependence is more prominent in Sumatra. Nevertheless, a maximum temperature variable is seemingly an important indicator for forest and land fire in both domains as it gives the largest contribution to the carbon emission. © 2023, Department of Informatics, UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, Indonesia.

To address this issue, we propose a novel salient object detection (SOD) network (DBINet) based on dual interactive convolution-transformer backbone for BAS in ORSIs. DBINet combines the benefits of CNN and transformer: CNN is good at extracting local spatial information, while transformer does well in modeling long-term dependencies. The core component of DBINet is three newly designed modules: dual-feature fusion module (DFM), convertor, and a novel decoder. Specifically, DFM is proposed to bridge two different backbones. Convertor is designed to fuse the multiscale coarse features from the main encoder and produce the fined feature for the decoder. The decoder has a multilevel feature aggregating process and a self-refining process, which restores the resolution and generates the prediction results. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our DBINet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best S-measure on three datasets: 0.847, 0.888, and 0.883.

However, due to the unavailability of spatial information technology, such databases are extremely difficult to build reliably and completely in the non-satellite era. This study presented an improved forest fire risk reconstruction framework that integrates a deep learning-based time series prediction model and spatial interpolation to address the challenge in Sichuan Province, southwestern China. First, the forest fire danger index (FFDI) was improved by supplementing slope and aspect information. We compared the performances of three time series models, namely, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Prophet and long short-term memory (LSTM) in predicting the modified forest fire danger index (MFFDI). The best-performing model was used to retrace the MFFDI of individual stations from 1941 to 1970. Following this, the Anusplin spatial interpolation method was used to map the distributions of the MFFDI at five-year intervals, which were then subjected to weighted overlay with the distance-to-river layer to generate forest fire risk maps for reconstructing the forest fire danger database. The results revealed LSTM as the most accurate in fitting and predicting the historical MFFDI, with a fitting determination coefficient (R2) of 0.709, mean square error (MSE) of 0.047, and validation R2 and MSE of 0.508 and 0.11, respectively. Independent validation of the predicted forest fire risk maps indicated that 5 out of 7 historical forest fire events were located in forest fire-prone areas, which is higher than the results determined from the original FFDI (2 out of 7). This proves the effectiveness of the improved MFFDI and indicates a high level of reliability of the historical forest fire risk reconstruction method proposed in this study. © 2024 The Authors",Anusplin; ARIMA; Forest fire risk reconstruction; LSTM; MFFDI; Prophet; Time series models,,KeAi Communications Co.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186108824,For.

Accordingly, this study focuses on developing a novel framework to assess forest fire risks and policy decisions on forest fire management in China. This framework integrated deep learning algorithms, geographic information, and multisource data. Compared to conventional approaches, our framework featured timesaving, easy implementation, and importantly, the use of deep learning that vividly integrates various factors from the environment and human activities. Information on 96,594 forest fire points from 2001 to 2019 was collected on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire hotspots from 2001 to 2019 from NASA's Fire Information Resource Management System. The information was classified into factors such as topography, climate, vegetation, and society. The prediction of forest fire risk was generated using a fully connected network model, and spatial autocorrelation used to analyze the spatial aggregation correlation of active fire hotspots in the whole area of China. The results show that high accuracy prediction of fire risks was achieved (accuracy 87.4%, positive predictive value 87.1%, sensitivity 88.9%, area under curve (AUC) 94.1%). Based on this, it was found that Chinese forest fire risk shows significant autocorrelation and agglomeration both in seasons and regions. For example, forest fire risk usually raises dramatically in spring and winter, and decreases in autumn and summer. Compared to the national average, Yunnan Province, Guangdong Province, and the Greater Hinggan Mountains region of Heilongjiang Province have higher fire risks. In contrast, a large region in central China has been recognized as having a long-term, low risk of forest fires. All forest risks in each region were recorded into the database and could contribute to the forest fire prevention. The successful assessment of forest fire risks in this study provides a comprehensive knowledge of fire risks in China over the last 20 years. Deep learning showed its advantage in integrating multiple factors in predicting forest fire risks. This technical framework is expected to be a feasible evaluation tool for the occurrence of forest fires in China. © 2022, Northeast Forestry University.",Deep learning; Forest fires; Management strategies; Risk zoning; Spatial autocorrelation,China; Guangdong; Heilongjiang; Yunnan; Autocorrelation; Decision making; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Information management; Learning algorithms; Losses; NASA; Risk assessment; Spatial variables measurement; Topography; Deep learning; Fire risks; Forest fires; Geographic information; Hotspots; Information data; Management strategies; Multisource data; Risk zoning; Spatial autocorrelations; autocorrelation; database; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; MODIS; prediction; risk assessment; Fires,Northeast Forestry University,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141432531,J.

The underlying mechanisms present increased complexity, with the phenomenon itself being characterized by a significant degree of stochasticity. For the above reasons, machine learning models and neural networks are being implemented. In the current study, two types of neural networks are implemented, namely, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF). These neural networks utilize information from the Fire Weather Index (FWI), Fosberg Fire Weather Index (FFWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), aiming to predict ignitions in a region of Greece. All indices have been developed through the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE). In addition, a new index is proposed named “Vegetation-Enhanced FWI” (FWIveg) in order to enhance the FWI with vegetation information from the NDVI. To increase the robustness of the methodology, a genetic algorithm-based approach was used in order to obtain algorithms for the calculation of the new index. Finally, an artificial neural network was implemented in order to predict the Mati wildfire in Attica, Greece (23 July 2018) by applying the new index FWIveg, aiming to assess both the effectiveness of the new index as well as the ability to predict ignition events using neural networks. Results highlight the effectiveness of the two indices in providing joint information for fire prediction through artificial intelligence-based approaches. © 2023 by the authors.",FWI; Google Earth Engine; Greece; NDVI; neural networks; wildfires,Attica; Greece; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; machine learning; NDVI; remote sensing; wildfire,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167896385,Sustainability,"Department of Planning and Regional Development, University of Thessaly, Volos, 38334, Greece; Department of Agriculture Crop Production and Rural Environment, University of Thessaly, Volos, 38446, Greece","Ntinopoulos N., Department of Planning and Regional Development, University of Thessaly, Volos, 38334, Greece; Sakellariou S., Department of Planning and Regional Development, University of Thessaly, Volos, 38334, Greece; Christopoulou O., Department of Planning and Regional Development, University of Thessaly, Volos, 38334, Greece; Sfougaris A., Department of Agriculture Crop Production and Rural Environment, University of Thessaly, Volos, 38446, Greece",,,,,,,"S.

The severity and frequency of wildfires have escalated in recent years, necessitating more effective prediction models. This study presents an application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for wildfire spread prediction, focusing on the use of atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) mechanisms in these networks. However, the black-box nature of these algorithms has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we proposed an explainable CNN model with an ASPP mechanism (CNN-ASPP) in this study. More specifically, we utilize the Next Day Wildfire Spread dataset, which includes environmental variables, to evaluate the performance of our model. The proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and another CNN model. Our results showed that CNN-ASPP achieved an F1-score of 97%, outperforming the ML methods with an F1-score of 90% for a neighborhood size of 7× 7. We also opened the black box and tried to explanation different convolutional layers based on the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm. Our findings indicate that larger dilation rates (DRs) can extract more meaningful features from the input data. This study contributes to the development of more transparent and accurate models for wildfire spread prediction, which could have significant implications for forest management and wildfire prevention strategies. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP); convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); wildfire spread,Convolution; Deep neural networks; Ecosystems; Fires; Forestry; Neural network models; Support vector machines; Atrous spatial pyramid pooling; Black boxes; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; F1 scores; Forest ecosystem; Neural network model; Spatial pyramids; Wildfire spread; XAI; artificial neural network; neighborhood; numerical model; prediction; support vector machine; wildfire; Forecasting,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196734760,IEEE Geosci.

Deep Learning (DL) has been extensively applied in wildfire prediction research. In the realm of wildfire prediction, previous deep learning methods have overlooked the inherent differences between static positional information and dynamic variables. Additionally, most existing deep learning models have not integrated the global system characteristics of the Earth’s features and teleconnection during the learning phase. Here, we propose a static location-aware ConvLSTM (SLA-ConvLSTM) model that is aware of static positional elements and interconnected with global information and teleconnection. The model we propose can discern the influence of dynamic variables across various geographical locations on predictive outcomes. Compared with other deep learning models, our SLA-ConvLSTM model has achieved commendable performance. The outcomes indicate that the collaborative interplay of spatiotemporal features and the extraction of static positional information present a promising technique for wildfire prediction. Moreover, the incorporation of climate indices and global feature variables enhances the predictive capability of the model in wildfire prediction. © 2024 by the authors.",deep learning; SLA-ConvLSTM; spatiotemporal; wildfire,Elements; Fires; Forecasts; Life; Models; Performance; Research; Variables; Climate change; Climate models; Deep learning; Fires; Learning systems; Danger prediction; Deep learning; Dynamic variables; Learning models; Location-aware; Positional information; Spatiotemporal; Static location-aware ConvLSTM; Teleconnections; Wildfire; climate change; learning; prediction; teleconnection; wildfire; Forecasting,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183317446,Forests,"College of Computer Science and Technology, Beihua University, Jilin, 132013, China; College of Computer Science and Technology, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, 130032, China","Ji Y., College of Computer Science and Technology, Beihua University, Jilin, 132013, China; Wang D., College of Computer Science and Technology, Beihua University, Jilin, 132013, China; Li Q., College of Computer Science and Technology, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, 130032, China; Liu T., College of Computer Science and Technology, Beihua University, Jilin, 132013, China; Bai Y., College of Computer Science and Technology, Beihua University, Jilin, 132013, China",,,,,,,"D.

Fire activity in arid, nonforested ecosystems is thought to be largely controlled by interannual variation in fuel amount, which in turn is controlled by antecedent weather. Thus, long-range forecasting of fire activity in rangelands should be feasible given annual estimates of fuel quantity. Using a 32-yr time series of spatial data, we employed machine learning algorithms to predict the relative probability of large (> 405 ha) wildfire in the Great Basin based on fine-scale annual and 16-d estimates of cover and production of vegetation functional groups, weather, and multitemporal scale drought indices. We evaluated the predictive utility of these models with a leave-1-yr-out cross-validation, building spatial hindcasts of fire probability for each year that we compared against actual footprints of large wildfires. Herbaceous aboveground biomass production, bare ground cover, and long-term drought indices were the most important predictors of burning. Across 32 fire seasons, 88% of the area burned in large wildfires coincided with the upper 3 deciles of predicted fire probabilities. At the scale of the Great Basin, several metrics of fire activity were moderately to strongly correlated with average fire probability, including total area burned in large wildfires, number of large wildfires, and maximum fire size. Our findings show that recent years of exceptional fire activity in the Great Basin were predictable based on antecedent weather-driven growth of fine fuels and reveal a significant increasing trend in fire probability over the past 3 decades driven by widespread changes in fine fuel characteristics. © 2022 The Author(s)",Cheatgrass; Drought; Fire; Fuels; Great Basin; Vegetation,Great Basin; United States; algorithm; drought; fuel; grass; hazard assessment; machine learning; prediction; smoke; vegetation dynamics; wildfire,Elsevier Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142140582,Rangeland Ecol.

If a fire is not detected and extinguished before it spreads, it can have disastrous results. In addition to satellite images, recent studies have shown that exploring both weather and topography characteristics is crucial for effectively predicting the propagation of wildfires. In this paper, we present FU-NetCastV2, a deep learning convolutional neural network for fire spread and burned area mapping. This algorithm predicts which areas around wildfires are at high risk of future spread. With an accuracy of 94.6% and an AUC of 97.7%, the model surpassed the literature by 3.7% and exhibited a 1.9% improvement over our previous model.

An early warning/monitoring system for forest fires was constructed based on deep learning and the internet of things. Forest fire recognition was improved by combining the size, color, and shape characteristics of the flame, smoke, and area. Complex upper-layer fire-image features were extracted, improving the input conversion by building a forest fire risk prediction model based on an improved dynamic convolutional neural network. The proposed back propagation neural network fire (BPNNFire) algorithm calculated the image processing speed and delay rate, and data were preprocessed to remove noise. The model recognized forest fire images, and the classifier classified them to distinguish images with and without fire. Fire images were classified locally for feature extraction. Forest fire images were stored on a remote server. Existing algorithms were compared, and BPNNFire provided real-time accurate forest fire recognition at a low frame rate with 84.37% accuracy, indicating superior recognition. The maximum relative error between the measured and actual values for real-time online monitoring of forest environment indicators, such as air temperature and humidity, was 5.75%. The packet loss rate of the forest fire monitoring network was 5.99% at Longshan Forest Farm and 2.22% at Longyandong Forest Farm. © 2023 by the authors.",back propagation neural network; convolutional neural network; deep learning; forest fire monitoring; internet of things (IoT),Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Image classification; Image enhancement; Internet of things; Multilayer neural networks; Smoke; Back-propagation neural networks; Classifieds; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Early warning; Fire recognition; Forest fire monitoring; Forest fires; Internet of thing; Real- time; Fires,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159315238,Remote Sens.,"Guangdong Eco-Engineering Polytechnic, Guangzhou, 510520, China; College of Electronic Engineering, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guangdong Academy of Forestry Sciences, Guangzhou, 510520, China; Zhujiang College, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Foshan-Zhongke Innovation Research Institute of Intelligent Agriculture and Robotics, Foshan, 528010, China","Zheng S., Guangdong Eco-Engineering Polytechnic, Guangzhou, 510520, China; Gao P., College of Electronic Engineering, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Zhou Y., Guangdong Academy of Forestry Sciences, Guangzhou, 510520, China; Wu Z., Guangdong Academy of Forestry Sciences, Guangzhou, 510520, China; Wan L., Guangdong Eco-Engineering Polytechnic, Guangzhou, 510520, China; Hu F., Guangdong Eco-Engineering Polytechnic, Guangzhou, 510520, China; Wang W., Zhujiang College, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Zou X., Foshan-Zhongke Innovation Research Institute of Intelligent Agriculture and Robotics, Foshan, 528010, China; Chen S., Guangdong Eco-Engineering Polytechnic, Guangzhou, 510520, China",,,,,,,"S.

To combine the advantages of pixelwise machine learning (ML) method and region-based deep learning (DL) segmentation model, this study proposes a two-phase hybrid framework for near real-time burned area progression mapping: the first one intends to depict burned area delimitation using a contextual algorithm HRNet to exclude the unburned areas outside the perimeter and minimize omission errors, which partially remain unburned patches within the delimitation as commission errors. The second phase refines the burned area spatially using ensemble fusion based on an updating support vector machine (SVM) model under the voting scheme as new imagery arrives to reduce the commission errors consecutively. The validation results showed that the accuracy of perimeter prediction using the HRNet can reach 96.77% in Kappa. The iterative optimization can improve the average Kappa value from 62.55% to 70.75% for burned area pixel classification using pixelwise SVM alone.

Process-based fire models quantify fire disturbance effects in stand-alone dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and their advances have incorporated both descriptions of natural processes and anthropogenic drivers. Nevertheless, these models show limited skill in modeling fire events at the global scale, due to stochastic characteristics of fire occurrence and behavior as well as the limits in empirical parameterizations in process-based models. As an alternative, machine learning has shown the capability of providing robust diagnostics of fire regimes. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based fire model (DL-fire) to estimate daily burnt area fraction at the global scale and couple it within JSBACH4, the land surface model used in the ICON-ESM. The stand-alone DL-fire model forced with meteorological, terrestrial and socio-economic variables is able to simulate global total burnt area, showing 0.8 of monthly correlation (rm) with GFED4 during the evaluation period (2011–2015). The performance remains similar with the hybrid modeling approach JSB4-DL-fire (rm = 0.79) outperforming the currently used uncalibrated standard fire model in JSBACH4 (rm = −0.07). We further quantify the importance of each predictor by applying layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Overall, land properties, such as fuel amount and water content in soil layers, stand out as the major factors determining burnt fraction in DL-fire, paralleled by meteorological conditions over tropical and high latitude regions. Our study demonstrates the potential of hybrid modeling in advancing fire prediction in ESMs by integrating deep learning approaches in physics-based dynamical models. © 2024 The Authors.

To mitigate the ecological damage caused by forest fires, it was necessary to develop prediction models of fire risk. In this study, by evolving the optimal architecture and parameters using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model was proposed to predict forest fire risk on a national scale. Utilizing fire data and fire risk factors from 2001 to 2020 in China, the PSO-CNN-based deep learning model (PSO-CNN) was utilized and tested. Compared to logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and CNN models, the PSO-CNN model exhibited superior performance with an accuracy of 82.2% and an AUC value of 0.92. These results clearly highlighted the effectiveness of the PSO-CNN model in enhancing the accuracy of forest fire prediction. Furthermore, the forest fire risk prediction level estimated by the proposed model on a national scale for the entire country was mostly consistent with actual fire data distribution, indicating its potential to be used as an important direction for deep learning in forest fire prediction research. © 2023 by the authors.",China; convolutional neural network; forest fire; nighttime lights; particle swarm optimization,Biodiversity; China; Deforestation; Ecology; Forecasts; Forest Fires; China; Biodiversity; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deforestation; Ecology; Forecasting; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural network models; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Risk perception; Support vector machines; China; Convolutional neural network; Fire risks; Forest fires; Learning models; Neural network model; Night time lights; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; algorithm; artificial neural network; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; optimization; prediction; risk assessment; Fires,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183327265,Forests,"College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Observatory, Chengdu, 610072, China","You X., College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Zheng Z., College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Yang K., Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Observatory, Chengdu, 610072, China; Yu L., College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Liu J., College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Chen J., College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Lu X., College of Resources and Environment, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Guo S., Sichuan Provincial Meteorological Observatory, Chengdu, 610072, China",,,,,,,"K.

Therefore, the development of a new risk model to assess the risk of forest fires is the main purpose at present. Zhenjiang City, China was set as the study area, and the original data around 2022 were applied to assess the forest fire risk. This study applied multi-criteria decision analysis technology and machine learning to construct a comprehensive assessment model. In addition, six methods were applied to evaluate the severity and display fire maps. Finally, four model parameters and receiver operating characteristic curves were applied to verify the accuracy of the model. The results show that the random forest has the best prediction effect. The accuracy and the area under the curve were 0.8086 and 0.9312, respectively. Moreover, land use, precipitation, and population density are the three most important factors. Therefore, the local government should strengthen the investigation of fire hazards and build a dynamic real-time natural disaster database. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Environmental management; Forest fire; Machine learning; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Risk analysis; Urban safety,,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195641035,Environ.

Therefore, timely and accurate detection of forest and rural wildfires is of great importance for successful fire containment and suppression efforts, as wildfires exponentially increase their spread rate from the moment of ignition. In the field of early smoke detection, the CICLOPE project currently trailblazes in the employment of a network of Remote Acquisition Towers for wildfire prevention and observation, along with a rule-based automatic smoke detection system, covering over 2, 700, 000 hectares of wildland and rural area in continental Portugal. However, the inherent challenges of automatic smoke detection raise issues of high false alarm rates that affect the system's prediction quality and overwhelm the Management and Control Centers with numerous false alarms. The research work presented in this paper evaluates the potential improvement in wildfire smoke detection accuracy and specificity using deep learning-based architectures. It proposes a solution based on a Dual-Channel CNN that can be deployed as a secondary prediction confirmation layer to further refine the CICLOPE automatic smoke detection system. The proposed solution takes advantage of the high true alarm coverage of the current detection system by taking only the predicted alarm images and respective bounding box coordinates as inputs. The Dual-Channel network combines the widely used DenseNet architecture with a novel detail selective network with spatial and channel attention modules trained separately with image data obtained from CICLOPE, fusing the extracted features from both networks in a concatenation layer. The results demonstrate that the proposed Dual-Channel CNN outperforms both single-channel networks, achieving an accuracy of 99.7% and a low false alarm rate of 0.20% when re-examining the alarms produced by the CICLOPE surveillance system. © 2013 IEEE.",Computer vision; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; smoke detection; wildfire detection,Alarm systems; Computer architecture; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Damage detection; Deep neural networks; Errors; Feature extraction; Fire detectors; Fires; Forestry; Image classification; Image resolution; Network architecture; Smoke; Computational modelling; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Detection algorithm; Features extraction; Images classification; Smoke detection; Wildfire; Wildfire detection; YOLO; Convolution,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194866235,IEEE Access,"Lovelytics, Arlington, 22201, VA, United States; Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), ISTAR, Lisbon, 1649-026, Portugal; INOV INESC Inovação, Instituto de Novas Tecnologias, Lisbon, 1000-029, Portugal","Goncalves A.M., Lovelytics, Arlington, 22201, VA, United States; Brandao T., Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), ISTAR, Lisbon, 1649-026, Portugal; Ferreira J.C., Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), ISTAR, Lisbon, 1649-026, Portugal, INOV INESC Inovação, Instituto de Novas Tecnologias, Lisbon, 1000-029, Portugal",,,,,,,"T.

To address this, our study applies the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to select the optimal parameters of the RF model, with the goal of enhancing model performance. We employ the optimized ensemble model (PSO-RF) to create a fire risk map for Jiushan National Forest Park in Anhui Province, China, thereby filling the research gap in this region’s forest fire studies. Based on collinearity tests and previous research results, we selected eight fire driving factors, including topography, climate, human activities, and vegetation for modeling. Additionally, we compare the logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and RF models. Lastly, we select the optimal model to evaluate feature importance and generate the fire risk map. Model evaluation results demonstrate that the PSO-RF model performs best (AUC = 0.908), followed by RF (0.877), SVM (0.876), and LR (0.846). In the fire risk map created by the PSO-RF model, 70.73% of the area belongs to the normal management zone, while 15.23% is classified as a fire alert zone. The feature importance analysis of the PSO-RF model reveals that the NDVI is the key fire driving factor in this study area. Through utilizing the PSO algorithm to optimize the RF model, we have addressed the subjective and empirical problems of the RF model hyperparameter setting, thereby enhancing the model’s accuracy and generalization ability. © 2023 by the authors.",fire risk map; forest fire prediction; machine learning; PSO-RF,Deforestation; Driving; Fires; Machinery; Maps; Performance; Research; Topography; Anhui; China; Brain; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Logistic regression; Maps; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Random forests; Support vector machines; Topography; Fire risk map; Fire risks; Forest fire prediction; Machine-learning; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization-random forest; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Risk maps; Swarm optimization; algorithm; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; optimization; regression analysis; Fires,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166264559,Forests,"College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China","Shi C., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Zhang F., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China",,,,,,,"F.

The impact of these fires on atmospheric composition is partially determined by the chemical breakup of the constituents of the fuel into individual emitted chemical species, which is described by emission factors (EFs). These EFs are known to be dependent on, amongst other things, the type of fuel consumed, the moisture content of the fuel, and the meteorological conditions during the fire, indicating that savanna EFs are temporally and spatially dynamic. Global emission inventories, however, rely on static biome-averaged EFs, which makes them ill-suited for the estimation of regional biomass burning (BB) emissions and for capturing the effects of shifts in fire regimes. In this study we explore the main drivers of EF variability within the savanna biome and assess which geospatial proxies can be used to estimate dynamic EFs for global emission inventories. We made over 4500 bag measurements of CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O EFs using a UAS and also measured fuel parameters and fire-severity proxies during 129 individual fires. The measurements cover a variety of savanna ecosystems under different seasonal conditions sampled over the course of six fire seasons between 2017 and 2022. We complemented our own data with EFs from 85 fires with locations and dates provided in the literature. Based on the locations, dates, and times of the fires we retrieved a variety of fuel, weather, and fire-severity proxies (i.e. possible predictors) using globally available satellite and reanalysis data. We then trained random forest (RF) regressors to estimate EFs for CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O at a spatial resolution of 0.25 and a monthly time step. Using these modelled EFs, we calculated their spatiotemporal impact on BB emission estimates over the 2002-2016 period using the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 with small fires (GFED4s). We found that the most important field indicators for the EFs of CO2, CO, and CH4 were tree cover density, fuel moisture content, and the grass-to-litter ratio. The grass-to-litter ratio and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio were important indicators for N2O EFs. RF models using satellite observations performed well for the prediction of EF variability in the measured fires with out-of-sample correlation coefficients between 0.80 and 0.99, reducing the error between measured and modelled EFs by 60%-85% compared to using the static biome average. Using dynamic EFs, total global savanna emission estimates for 2002-2016 were 1.8% higher for CO, while CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were, respectively, 0.2%, 5%, and 18% lower compared to GFED4s. On a regional scale we found a spatial redistribution compared to GFED4s with higher CO, CH4, and N2O EFs in mesic regions and lower ones in xeric regions. Over the course of the fire season, drying resulted in gradually lower EFs of these species. Relatively speaking, the trend was stronger in open savannas than in woodlands, where towards the end of the fire season they increased again. Contrary to the minor impact on annual average savanna fire emissions, the model predicts localized deviations from static averages of the EFs of CO, CH4, and N2O exceeding 60% under seasonal conditions.  © 2023 Roland Vernooij et al.",,Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Machine learning; Moisture; Moisture determination; Satellites; Biomass burning emissions; Condition; Database versions; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Fire emissions; Fire severity; Global emissions; Global fire; Small fire; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; machine learning; pollution monitoring; savanna; Fires,Copernicus Publications,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178013097,Earth Syst.

Among the top 20 California wildfires, those in 2020–2021 burned more acres than the last century combined. Lack of an adequate early warning system impacts the health and safety of vulnerable populations disproportionately and widens the inequality gap. In this project, a multi-modal wildfire prediction and early warning system has been developed based on a novel spatio-temporal machine learning architecture. A comprehensive wildfire database with over 37 million data points was created, including the historical wildfires, environmental and meteorological sensor data from the Environmental Protection Agency, and geological data. The data was augmented into 2.53 km × 2.53 km square grids to overcome the sensor network coverage limitations. Leading and trailing indicators for the wildfires are proposed, classified, and tested. The leading indicators are correlated to the risks of wildfire conception, whereas the trailing indicators are correlated to the byproducts of the wildfires. Additionally, geological data was incorporated to provide additional information for better assessment on wildfire risks and propagation. Next, a novel U-Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ULSTM) neural network was developed to extract key spatial and temporal features of the dataset, specifically to address the spatial nature of the location of the wildfire and time-progression temporal nature of the wildfire evolution. Through iterative improvements and optimization, the final ULSTM network architecture, trained with data from 2012 to 2017, achieved >97% accuracy for predicting wildfires in 2018, as compared to ∼76% using traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques. The final model was applied to conduct a retrospective study for the 2018–2022 wildfire seasons, and successfully predicted 85.7% of wildfires >300 K acres in size. This technique could enable fire departments to anticipate and prevent wildfires before they strike and provide early warnings for at-risk individuals for better preparation, thereby saving lives, protecting the environment, and avoiding economic damages. © 2023",Artificial intelligence; Disaster prediction; Machine learning; Remote sensor network; Wildfire,"Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Wildfires; California; United States; Backpropagation; Convolution; Environmental Protection Agency; Fires; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Network architecture; Neural networks; Sensor networks; Disaster prediction; Early Warning System; Geological data; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Remote sensor network; Remote sensors; Sensors network; Wildfire; artificial intelligence; early warning system; health and safety; machine learning; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; adult; air quality; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation; convolutional neural network; data accuracy; environmental factor; environmental protection; female; human; long short term memory network; male; meteorological phenomena; predictive model; retrospective study; risk assessment; season; u convolutional long short term memory; vegetation; wildfire; artificial neural network; machine learning; Risk assessment",Academic Press,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159203031,J.

Heterogeneity is a key challenge in federated settings. Recently, cross-technology communication (CTC) has emerged as a solution for Internet of Things (IoT) heterogeneity, enabling direct communication between different wireless devices without the need for hardware modifications or gateway intervention. For example, a sophisticated WiFi device can serve as a central coordinator for other heterogeneous devices, such as LoRa, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE, leading to more efficient and ubiquitous cross-network information exchange. However, heterogeneous wireless technologies present different data transmission rates and computing resources, making it difficult to achieve high accuracy in predictions due to large amounts of multidimensional data, communication delays, transmission latency, limited processing capacity, and data privacy concerns. In this work, we propose an FL framework based on CTC for heterogeneous IoT applications, called FLCTC. To demonstrate the usability of FLCTC, we implemented FLCTC and a specific solution for forest fire prediction. FLCTC was concretely implemented as a federal deep learning based on long and short-term memory and used for forest fire prediction, addressing the challenge of data characterization in heterogeneous IoT networks. FLCTC promises to improve communication efficiency and prediction accuracy. Our platform-based evaluation results show that FLCTC is feasible, with a recall of 96% and an accuracy of 88%, offering valuable insights into the use of FL with CTC for heterogeneous IoT applications.  © 2014 IEEE.",Cross-technology communication (CTC); federated learning (FL); heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) networks,Data privacy; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Wi-Fi; Cross-technology communication; Data collection; Federated learning; Forest fire prediction; Heterogeneous IoT network; Machine learning techniques; Technology communications; Wireless communications; Wireless fidelities; Zigbee,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168275130,IEEE Internet Things J.,"Nanjing Forestry University, College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210037, China; University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Minneapolis, 55414, MN, United States; Zhejiang University, College of Control Science and Engineering, Hangzhou, 310027, China; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing, 210003, China; City University of Hong Kong, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Southeast University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing, 211189, China; Peking University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beijing, 100871, China","Gao D., Nanjing Forestry University, College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210037, China, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Minneapolis, 55414, MN, United States; Wang H., Nanjing Forestry University, College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210037, China; Guo X., Zhejiang University, College of Control Science and Engineering, Hangzhou, 310027, China; Wang L., Nanjing Forestry University, College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210037, China; Gui G., Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing, 210003, China; Wang W., City University of Hong Kong, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Yin Z., City University of Hong Kong, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Wang S., Southeast University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing, 211189, China; Liu Y., Peking University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beijing, 100871, China; He T., University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Minneapolis, 55414, MN, United States",,,,,,,"D.

K-means clustering classifies wildfires into four types with distinct AHCs: low-PS-type and high-PS-type with lower and higher PS anomalies, respectively, LW-type featuring intense LW but weak SW anomalies, and wet-soil-type with wet soil anomalies. Each fire cluster represents 22%–27% of all the wildfires, featuring different combinations of climate and vegetation conditions and their diverse relations to regional hydrometeorological conditions, with wet-soil-type fires often exhibiting opposite correlations with AHCs compared to those of the other three types. In five major Köppen climate zones over the western U.S., clustering-based predictions improve the seasonal wildfire prediction accuracy (R2) by 10% compared to prediction without classification. Such improvement comes from separating the opposite relationships between wet-soil-type fires and their seasonal AHCs from the other three types, along with separating LW-type fires, which include most of the lightning-ignited fires that occur more randomly. Increases in wildfire occurrence during 1984–2018 are dominated by the increases in the LW-type fires, while the wet-soil-type fires have decreased, consistent with the long-term drying in the western U.S. © 2023 Battelle Memorial Institute.",climate change; extreme events; hydroclimate; machine learning; wildfire,climate change; computer simulation; extreme event; hydrometeorology; image resolution; machine learning; regional climate; surface pressure; wildfire,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176373530,J.

To lessen potential fire threats, it is helpful to recognize fire occurrence patterns and identify fire susceptibility in wildfire-prone regions. The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms is acknowledged as one of the most well-known methods for addressing non-linear issues like wildfire hazards. It has always been difficult to analyze these multivariate environmental disasters because modeling can be influenced by a variety of sources of uncertainty, including the quantity and quality of training procedures and input variables. Moreover, although ML techniques show promise in this field, they are unstable for a number of reasons, including the usage of irrelevant descriptor characteristics when developing the models. Explainable AI (XAI) can assist us in acquiring insights into these constraints and, consequently, modifying the modeling approach and training data necessary. In this research, we describe how a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) model can be utilized to interpret the results of a deep learning (DL) model that is developed for wildfire susceptibility prediction. Different contributing factors such as topographical, landcover/vegetation, and meteorological factors are fed into the model and various SHAP plots are used to identify which parameters are impacting the prediction model, their relative importance, and the reasoning behind specific decisions. The findings drawn from SHAP plots show the significant contributions made by factors such as humidity, wind speed, rainfall, elevation, slope, and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) to the suggested model's output for wildfire susceptibility mapping. We infer that developing an explainable model would aid in comprehending the model's decision to map wildfire susceptibility, pinpoint high-contributing components in the prediction model, and consequently control fire hazards effectively. © 2023 The Authors",Deep learning; GIS; Machine learning; SHAP; Wildfire susceptibility; XAI,Australia; Deep learning; Disasters; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Learning systems; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Community IS; Contributing factor; Deep learning; Environmental catastrophe; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Wildfire susceptibilities; XAI; artificial intelligence; factor analysis; GIS; machine learning; multivariate analysis; satellite data; topography; wildfire; air pollution; algal bloom; Article; artificial intelligence; decision making; deep learning; disaster; human; humidity; intelligence; machine learning; mathematical model; meteorological phenomena; nonhuman; particulate matter; prediction; predictive value; prevalence; quantitative structure activity relation; reasoning; receiver operating characteristic; systematic review; uncertainty; vegetation; wildfire; wind speed; Fires,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151398676,Sci.

Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia that has experienced a severe number of wildfires, which have dangerous impacts on neighboring countries due to the emission of carbon and haze to the free air. The objective of this research is to map and plot the locations that consist of a significant number of fire hotspots and forecast the possible forest fire disasters in Indonesia based on the collected data of forest fires. The results of forecasting data are beneficial for the government and its policymakers to take preventive action and countermeasures regarding this wildfire issue. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, a deep learning method, was applied to analyze and then forecast the number of wildfire hotspots. The wildfire hotspot dataset from the year 2010 to 2022 is derived from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The total number of collected observations is more than 700,000 wildfire data in Indonesia. The distribution of wildfire hotspots as shown in the results is concentrated mainly on two big islands, Kalimantan and Sumatra, Indonesia. The main issue is the peat type of land that is prone to spreading fire. Forecasting the number of hotspots for 2023 has achieved good results with an average error of 7%. Additionally, to prove that the proposed algorithm is working well, a simulation has been conducted using training data from 2018 to 2022 and testing data from 2021 to 2022. The forecasting result achieved a similar pattern of the number of fire hotspots compared to the available data in 2021 and 2022. © 2023 by the authors.",environment monitoring; Indonesia; LSTM algorithm; mapping and forecasting; wildfire hotspots,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166405109,Environ. - MDPI,"Department of Informatics Engineering, Universitas Islam Riau, Pekanbaru, 28284, Indonesia; Department of Computer Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02134, MA, United States; Department of Computer Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 22254, Saudi Arabia; Center for Environmental Remote Sensing, Chiba University, Chiba, 263-8522, Japan; Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Science, University Teknologi MARA, Arau, 02600, Malaysia","Kadir E.A., Department of Informatics Engineering, Universitas Islam Riau, Pekanbaru, 28284, Indonesia; Kung H.T., Department of Computer Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02134, MA, United States; AlMansour A.A., Department of Computer Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 22254, Saudi Arabia; Irie H., Center for Environmental Remote Sensing, Chiba University, Chiba, 263-8522, Japan; Rosa S.L., Department of Informatics Engineering, Universitas Islam Riau, Pekanbaru, 28284, Indonesia; Fauzi S.S.M., Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Science, University Teknologi MARA, Arau, 02600, Malaysia",,,,,,,"E.A.

To this end, we used a combination of data from geostationary satellites and polar orbit satellites to correct the FRP data. Incorporating various factors that affect wildfire spread, such as meteorological conditions, topography, vegetation indexes, and population density, we constructed a comprehensive California wildfire spread dataset, covering information since 2017. Then, we established a deep learning framework that integrates various modules to analyze multimodal data for the accurate prediction of FRP imagery. We investigated the impact of input sequence length and loss function design on model predictive performance, leading to subsequent model optimization. Furthermore, our model has demonstrated acceptable performance in transfer learning and multistep prediction, emphasizing its application value in wildfire prediction and management. It can provide more detailed information about wildfire spread, showcasing the powerful capability of deep learning to process multimodal data and its potential in the emerging field of real-time FRP prediction.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Deep learning; fire radiative power (FRP); remote sensing; spatiotemporal prediction; wildfire,California; United States; Biological systems; Deep learning; Forecasting; Forestry; Geostationary satellites; Orbits; Population statistics; Vegetation; Biological system modeling; Deep learning; Fire radiative power; Predictive models; Remote-sensing; Spatio-temporal prediction; Vegetation mapping; Wildfire; geostationary satellite; machine learning; prediction; radiative forcing; real time; remote sensing; satellite data; wildfire; Remote sensing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194027822,IEEE J.

However, accounting for the nonlinear, spatially heterogeneous interactions between climate, vegetation, and human predictors driving the trends in fire frequency and sizes at different spatial scales remains a challenging problem for statistical fire models. Here we introduce a novel stochastic machine learning (SML) framework, SMLFire1.0, to model observed fire frequencies and sizes in 12 km × 12 km grid cells across the WUS. This framework is implemented using mixture density networks trained on a wide suite of input predictors. The modeled WUS fire frequency matches observations at both monthly (r = 0.94) and annual (r = 0.85) timescales, as do the monthly (r = 0.90) and annual (r = 0.88) area burned. Moreover, the modeled annual time series of both fire variables exhibit strong correlations (r ≥ 0:6) with observations in 16 out of 18 ecoregions. Our ML model captures the interannual variability and the distinct multidecade increases in annual area burned for both forested and non-forested ecoregions. Evaluating predictor importance with Shapley additive explanations, we find that fire-month vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is the dominant driver of fire frequencies and sizes across the WUS, followed by 1000 h dead fuel moisture (FM1000), total monthly precipitation (Prec), mean daily maximum temperature (Tmax), and fraction of grassland cover in a grid cell. Our findings serve as a promising use case of ML techniques for wildfire prediction in particular and extreme event modeling more broadly. They also highlight the power of MLdriven parameterizations for potential implementation in fire modules of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and earth system models (ESMs). © Copyright: ",,United States; additive; extreme event; grassland; machine learning; time series analysis; vapor pressure; vegetation dynamics; wildfire,Copernicus Publications,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164252735,Geoscientific Model Dev.,"Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, New York, NY, United States; Department of Geography, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, United States; Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY, United States; Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States","Buch J., Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, New York, NY, United States; Williams A.P., Department of Geography, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, United States; Juang C.S., Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, New York, NY, United States, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Hansen W.D., Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY, United States; Gentine P., Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States",,,,,,,"J.

The ability to foresee the onset of such a natural disaster is, thus, of paramount importance in reducing this risk. There have been numerous proposed technologies and novel approaches for detecting and preventing forest fires. Integrating AI to automate fire prediction and detection is becoming increasingly common. To provide effective forest fire detection, people make use of several technological expansions, with the IoT for data collecting and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the forecast process. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key study technique that has been proven to be the best in enhancing the presentation of detecting fire threats in important locations by several researchers. Due to the importance of object detection in this investigation, EfficientDet was chosen for implementation. It is suggested that fire breakouts be detected using a Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (RLSTM-NN). Here, we propose a Cat Swarm Fractional Calculus Optimization (CSFCO) algorithm for deep learning that combines the best features of Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with fractional calculus for optimal training results (FC). Terms of the simulation results reveal that the suggested process outdoes the state-of-the-art approaches. The suggested typical can identify the onset of a fire with a precision of 98.6% and an error rate of only 0.14%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial intelligence; Cat swarm fractional calculus optimization; EfficientDet; Forest fire detection; Internet of things; Neural network,Deforestation; Disasters; Fire hazards; Fires; Long short-term memory; Object detection; Cat swarm fractional calculus optimization; Efficientdet; Environmental crisis; Fire detection systems; Forest fire detection; Forest fires; Fractional calculus; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Real-world; Internet of things,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85170290485,Comput Commun,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Saveetha School of Engineering, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, India; Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Sree Vidyaniketan Engineering College, Mohan Babu University, Andhra Pradesh, Tirupati, India; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Alliance College of Engineering and Design, Alliance University, Bangalore, India; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Hindustan Institute of Technology & Science, Chennai, India; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kongunadu College of Engineering and Technology, Namakkal-Trichy Main Road, Tholurpatti PO, Thottiam TK, Trichy DT, Tamilnadu, 621215, India; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, St. Martin's Engineering College, Telangana, Secunderabad, India","Mahaveerakannan R, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Saveetha School of Engineering, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, India; Anitha C., Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Sree Vidyaniketan Engineering College, Mohan Babu University, Andhra Pradesh, Tirupati, India; Aby K Thomas, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Alliance College of Engineering and Design, Alliance University, Bangalore, India; Rajan S., Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Hindustan Institute of Technology & Science, Chennai, India; Muthukumar T., Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kongunadu College of Engineering and Technology, Namakkal-Trichy Main Road, Tholurpatti PO, Thottiam TK, Trichy DT, Tamilnadu, 621215, India; Govinda Rajulu G., Department of Computer Science & Engineering, St. Martin's Engineering College, Telangana, Secunderabad, India",COCOD,,,,,,"Mahaveerakannan R; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Saveetha School of Engineering, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; email: mahaveerakannanr.sse@saveetha.com",,,,,01403664,English,,,,"Zhang J., Li W., Yin Z., Liu S., Guo X., Forest fire detection system based on wireless sensor network, Proceedings of the 4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA 2009), pp. 520-523, (2009); Yu L., Wang N., Meng X., Real-time Forest fire detection with wireless sensor networks, Proceedings of the International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, pp. 1214-1217, (2005); Chen S.J., Hovde D.C., Peterson K.A., Marshall A.W., Fire detection using smoke and gas sensors, Fire Saf.

Physics-driven models, such as cellular automata and computational fluid dynamics can provide high-fidelity fire spread simulations but they are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Much effort has been put into developing machine learning models for fire prediction. However, these models are often region-specific and require a substantial quantity of simulation data for training purpose. This results in a significant amount of computational effort for different ecoregions. In this work, a generative model is proposed using a three-dimensional Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders to generate spatial-temporal sequences of unseen wildfire burned areas in a given ecoregion. The model is tested in the ecoregion of a recent massive wildfire event in California, known as the Chimney fire. Numerical results show that the model succeed in generating coherent and structured fire scenarios, taking into account the impact from geophysical variables, such as vegetation and slope. Generated data are also used to train a surrogate model for predicting wildfire dissemination, which has been tested on both simulation data and the real Chimney fire event.  © 2017 IEEE.",Deep learning; generative model; spatial-temporal system; surrogate model; wildfire,Computational fluid dynamics; Deep learning; Fires; Support vector machines; Computational modelling; Deep learning; Generative model; MODIS; Predictive models; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal system; Support vectors machine; Surrogate modeling; Temporal systems; Training data; Wildfire; Chimneys,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167779171,IEEE Trans.

Humans are responsible for the majority of fire ignitions. Physical and empirical models are used to estimate the future effects of fires on vegetation dynamics and the Earth’s system. However, there is no consensus on how human-caused fire ignitions should be represented in such models. This study aimed to identify which globally available predictors of human activity explain global fire ignitions as observed by satellites. We applied a random forest machine learning framework to state-of-the-art global climate, vegetation, and land cover datasets to establish a baseline against which influences of socioeconomic data (cropland fraction, gross domestic product (GDP), road density, livestock density, grazed lands) on fire ignition occurrence were evaluated. Our results showed that a baseline random forest without human predictors captured the spatial patterns of fire ignitions globally, with hotspots over Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. Adding single human predictors to the baseline model revealed that human variables vary in their effects on fire ignitions and that of the variables considered GDP is the most vital driver of fire ignitions. A combined model with all human predictors showed that the human variables improve the ignition predictions in most regions of the world, with some regions exhibiting worse predictions than the baseline model. We concluded that an ensemble of human predictors can add value to physical and empirical models. There are complex relationships between the variables, as evidenced by the improvement in bias in the combined model compared to the individual models. Furthermore, the variables tested have complex relationships that random forests may struggle to disentangle. Further work is required to detangle the complex regional relationships between these variables. These variables, e.g., population density, are well documented to have substantial effects on fire at local and regional scales; we determined that these variables may provide more insight at more continental scales. © 2023 by the authors.",fire; machine learning; socioeconomic drivers,,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160263279,Fire,"Climate and Environmental Remote Sensing Research Unit, Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Wiedner Hauptstraße 8-10, Vienna, 1040, Austria; Institute for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden), Dresden, 01062, Germany; Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBiK-F), Frankfurt am Main, 60325, Germany","Mukunga T., Climate and Environmental Remote Sensing Research Unit, Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Wiedner Hauptstraße 8-10, Vienna, 1040, Austria; Forkel M., Institute for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden), Dresden, 01062, Germany; Forrest M., Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBiK-F), Frankfurt am Main, 60325, Germany; Zotta R.-M., Climate and Environmental Remote Sensing Research Unit, Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Wiedner Hauptstraße 8-10, Vienna, 1040, Austria; Pande N., Climate and Environmental Remote Sensing Research Unit, Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Wiedner Hauptstraße 8-10, Vienna, 1040, Austria; Schlaffer S., Climate and Environmental Remote Sensing Research Unit, Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Wiedner Hauptstraße 8-10, Vienna, 1040, Austria; Dorigo W., Climate and Environmental Remote Sensing Research Unit, Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Wiedner Hauptstraße 8-10, Vienna, 1040, Austria",,,,,,,"T.

Wildfires burn tens of thousands of square kilometres of forests and vegetation every year in the United States alone with the past decade witnessing a dramatic increase in the number of wildfire incidents. This research aims to understand the regions of forests and vegetation across the US that are susceptible to wildfires using spatiotemporal kernel heat maps and, forecast these wildfires across the United States at country-wide and state levels on a weekly and monthly basis in an attempt to reduce the reaction time of the suppression operations and effectively design resource maps to mitigate wildfires. We employed the state-of-the-art Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series (N-BEATS) model to predict the total area burned by wildfires by several weeks and months into the future. The model was evaluated based on forecasting metrics including mean-squared error (MSE)., and mean average error (MAE). The N-BEATS model demonstrates improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, obtaining MSE values of 116.3, 38.2, and 19.0 for yearly, monthly, and weekly forecasting, respectively. © 2024 by the author(s).",Deep learning; Forecasting; Time-series; Wildfires,Deep learning; Fires; Forestry; Mean square error; Time series; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Deep learning; Heat maps; Mean squared error; Spatiotemporal kernel; State of the art; Time series forecasting models; Times series; Times series models; Warming climate; Wildfire; Forecasting,International Association for Educators and Researchers (IAER),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190438192,Ann.

The economic, environmental, and societal consequences of these fires can last several years after the wildfire. Often, it is possible to avoid such disasters if the detection of the outbreak of fire is fast enough, reliable, and early. The lack of datasets has limited the methods used to predict wildfires in Algeria to the mapping risk areas, which is updated annually. This study is the result of the availability of a recent dataset relating the history of forest fires in the cities of Bejaia and Sidi Bel-Abbes during the year 2012. The dataset being small size, we used principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables to 6, while retaining 96.65% of the total variance. Moreover, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN) with two hidden layers to predict wildfires in these cities. Next, we trained and compared the performance of our classifier with those provided by the Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest classifiers, using a 10-fold stratified cross-validation. The experiment shows a slight superiority of the ANN classifier compared to the others, in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Our classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.967±0.026 and F1-score of 0.971±0.023. The SHAP technique revealed the importance of the features (RH, DC, ISI) in the predictions of the ANN model. © 2023 The Author",Artificial intelligence; Cross-validation; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Wildfire forecasting,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165303779,Heliyon,"Department of Mathematics, College of Science, Qassim University, P.O.Box 6644, KSA, Buraydah, 51452, Saudi Arabia","Zaidi A., Department of Mathematics, College of Science, Qassim University, P.O.Box 6644, KSA, Buraydah, 51452, Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,"A.

The presented methodology uses artificial neural networks, bagging and boosting in ensemble learning algorithms, and traditional machine learning algorithms decision tree regression, Gaussian process regression and support vector regression to determine the size of the area to be burned in a forest fire that will start. The Bayesian optimization algorithm, which is used in the learning process of the methods, provides the optimum hyperparameter values of the methods to obtain the minimum error value. The methodology, which is first used to predict the size of the fires that occurred in different regions of Turkey between 2015 and 2019, yielded successful results. Second, it is applied to the Montesinho Natural Park forest fire dataset in Portugal to validate its robustness in different geographical regions. Finally, the results are compared with different studies in the literature. Compared with the literature, it is seen that the presented methodology has high accuracy and high speed in the prediction of the burned area. The results of the study are significant as the proposed methodology provides valuable information to the authorized units regarding resource planning during the forest fire response phase. Furthermore, the findings show that the presented methodology is reliable and can be used as an additional tool to predict the burned area for different countries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Artificial neural networks; Bayesian optimization; Machine learning; Prediction; Wildfire,Portugal; Turkey; algorithm; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; comparative study; forest fire; hazard management; prediction,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171634492,Nat.

This risk has been assessed by various authors using many different methods and numerical models. Among these approaches, machine learning models have been successfully applied to determine the weights of criteria in risk assessment and risk prediction studies. In Istanbul, data have been collected for areas that are yet to be urbanized but are foreseen to be at risk using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies based on fires that occurred between 2000 and 2021. Here, the land use/land cover (LULC) characteristics of the region were examined, and machine learning techniques, including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting (LGB) models, were applied to classify the factors that affect fires. The RF model yielded the best results, with an accuracy of 0.70, an F1 score of 0.71, and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.76. In the RF model, the grouping between factors that initiate fires and factors that influence the spread of fires was distinct, and this distinction was also somewhat observable in the other two models. Risk scores were generated through the multiplication of the variable importance values of the factors and their respective layer values, culminating in a risk map for the region. The distribution of risk is in alignment with the number of fires that have previously occurred, and the risk in wildland–urban interface areas was found to be significantly higher than the risk in wildland areas alone. © 2023 by the authors.",fire risk; GIS; machine learning classification; rural–urban interface; wildland–urban interface,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175353894,Fire,"Department of Geographic Information Systems, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Department of Electricity and Energy, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems Graduate Program, Institute of Natural and Applied Sciences, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Department of Construction, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Department of Civil Defense and Firefighting, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey","Aksoy E., Department of Geographic Information Systems, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Kocer A., Department of Electricity and Energy, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Yilmaz İ., Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems Graduate Program, Institute of Natural and Applied Sciences, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Akçal A.N., Department of Construction, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey; Akpinar K., Department of Civil Defense and Firefighting, Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey",,,,,,,"K.

These challenges include extreme temperatures, smoke, toxic gases, explosions, and falling objects, which can hinder their efficiency and pose risks to their safety. Accurate information and data about the burning site can help firefighters make informed decisions about their duties and determine when it is safe to enter and evacuate, reducing the likelihood of casualties. This research presents unsupervised deep learning (DL) to classify the danger levels at a burning site and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) prediction model to forecast temperature changes using the extrapolation of a random forest regressor. The DL classifier algorithms provide the chief firefighter with an awareness of the danger levels in the burning compartment. The prediction models forecast the rise in temperature from a height ranging from 0.6 m to 2.6 m and the changes in temperature over time at an altitude of 2.6 m. Predicting the temperature at this altitude is critical as the temperature increases faster with height, and elevated temperatures can weaken the building’s structural material. We also investigated a new classification method using an unsupervised DL autoencoder artificial neural network (AE-ANN). The prediction data analytical approach included using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with random forest regression implementation. The proposed AE-ANN model, with an accuracy score of 0.869, did not perform as well compared to previous work, with an accuracy of 0.989, at achieving high accuracy scores for the classification task using the same dataset. However, the random forest regressor and our ARIMA models are analyzed and evaluated in this work, while other research has not utilized this dataset, even though it is open-sourced. However, the ARIMA model demonstrated remarkable predictions of the trends of temperature changes in a burning site. The proposed research aims to classify fire sites into dangerous levels and predict temperature progression using deep learning and predictive modeling techniques. This research’s main contribution is using a random forest regressor and autoregressive integrated moving average models to predict temperature trends in burning sites. This research demonstrates the potential of using deep learning and predictive modeling to enhance firefighter safety and decision-making processes. © 2023 by the authors.",ANN; ARIMA; autoencoder; deep learning; fire; firefighting; random forest regression,Classification (of information); Decision making; Deep learning; Efficiency; Fire extinguishers; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Neural networks; Smoke; ANN; Auto encoders; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average; Deep learning; Firefighting; Moving average model; Moving averages; Random forest regression; Random forests; Fires,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160452270,Sensors,"Ingram School of Engineering, Texas State University, San Marcos, 78666, TX, United States","Ishola A.A., Ingram School of Engineering, Texas State University, San Marcos, 78666, TX, United States; Valles D., Ingram School of Engineering, Texas State University, San Marcos, 78666, TX, United States",,,,,,,"D.

While high-fidelity models derived from first principles offer physical accuracy, they are too computationally expensive for use in real-time fire response. Low-fidelity models sacrifice some physical accuracy and generalizability via the integration of empirical measurements, but enable real-time simulations for operational use in fire response. Machine learning techniques have demonstrated the ability to bridge these objectives by learning first-principles physics while achieving computational speedups. While deep learning approaches have demonstrated the ability to predict wildfire propagation over large time periods, time-resolved fire-spread predictions are needed for active fire management. In this work, we evaluate the ability of deep learning approaches in accurately modeling the time-resolved dynamics of wildfires. We use an autoregressive process in which a convolutional recurrent deep learning model makes predictions that propagate a wildfire over 15 min increments. We apply the model to four simulated datasets of increasing complexity, containing both field fires with homogeneous fuel distribution as well as real-world topologies sampled from the California region of the United States. We show that even after 100 autoregressive predictions representing more than 24 h of simulated fire spread, the resulting models generate stable and realistic propagation dynamics, achieving a Jaccard score between 0.89 and 0.94 when predicting the resulting fire scar. The inference time of the deep learning models are examined and compared, and directions for future work are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Deep neural networks; Machine learning; Recurrent neural networks; Wildland fires,Convolution; Deep neural networks; Fires; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Topology; Fire response; Fire spread; First principles; High-fidelity modeling; Learning approach; Learning models; Machine-learning; Modelling time; Time-resolved; Wildland fire; Forecasting,Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166970704,Fire Technol.,"Google Research, Mountain View, 94043, CA, United States; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, CA, United States; Department of Photon Science, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, 94025, CA, United States","Burge J., Google Research, Mountain View, 94043, CA, United States; Bonanni M.R., Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, CA, United States; Hu R.L., Google Research, Mountain View, 94043, CA, United States; Ihme M., Google Research, Mountain View, 94043, CA, United States, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, CA, United States, Department of Photon Science, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, 94025, CA, United States",FITCA,,,,,,"J.

This study looked at how climate change affects wildfire spread via prediction in the Guinean savannah (GSZ) and the forest-savannah mosaic (FSZ) in Ghana. Random forest regression was employed to attain this goal. As a result, the CCLM4-8-17 model outputs were employed and analyzed under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), since they better forecast the climate of the biological zones studied with less error (R2, RMSE, Bias, Spearman Correlation). As a result, there is a decrease in rainfall over the simulated period (2022–2100) in both zones (FSZ, GSZ), considering both scenarios (RCP4.5; RCP8.5), and an increase in temperature in FSZ (+0.08 °C for RCP4.5 and 0.1 °C for RCP8.5) and GZS (+0.04 °C for RCP4 and +0.09 °C for RCP8.5). Under RCP4 and RCP8 scenarios, the average number of active fires (HS) on their part shows that the average near future (2022–2060) will have more areas favourable to fire activities (active points) in both ecological zones: RCP4_GSZ_HS (316 n), RCP4_FSZ_HS (252 n), RCP8_GSZ_HS (333 n), RCP8_FSZ_HS (285 n), followed by the average far future (2061–2100) The average burnt area (BA) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.4 that average near future (2022–2060) will also contain a more burnt area in both ecological zones: RCP4_GSZ_BA (25290.96 ha), RCP4_FSZ_BA (20758.51 ha), RCP8_GSZ_BA (25766.66 ha), RCP8_FSZ_BA (20699.91 ha) followed by average for far future (2061–2100): RCP4_GSZ_BA (14849.20 ha), RCP4_FSZ_BA (11782.11 ha), RCP8_GSZ_BA (19,299.07 ha), RCP8_FSZ_BA (1072.01 ha). Thus, under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, tmax_RP4, SM, and ETA contribute more to fire activity and spread in the GSZ. However, in the FSZ, RH, tmax_RP4, and SM contribute more to fire activity and spread in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, with varying amounts. Because of the above, decision-makers and academics must take tangible steps to develop novel techniques to minimise the future impacts of fires. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Climate change; Forest-savanna mosaic zone; Ghana; Guinea-Savanna zone; Random forest; Wildfire,,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181722670,Remote Sens.

The objective of this short communication is to assess the capability of a fast and easy-to-implement random forest algorithm to estimate cumulative probabilities fire frequency and burned area using a large dataset collected in the USA. The input variables of the algorithm are voluntary restricted to climate and land use factors, which are easy to obtain in practice. No input related to fire frequency, burned area, or to any other fire characteristic is used. After model selection and training, the performance of random forest is assessed using an independent dataset including 80,000 observations of fire occurrence and burned area. Results show that the score of our simple random forest algorithm is 9% higher than the score of the winner of the data challenge of Opitz (Extreme, 2022) revealing that, although this model has a good performance, it is not the best. However, the approach proposed here can be implemented using standard packages, does not require any fire monitoring system after training, and requires little specialized knowledge in machine learning, which makes it usable by a large diversity of stakeholders. The results of this study suggest that random forest should be part of the toolbox of engineers and scientists involved in wildfire prediction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Fire; Forecast; Probability; Random forest,,Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144965469,Extremes,"UMR MIA Paris-Saclay, Université Paris-Saclay INRAE AgroParisTech, Palaiseau, 91120, France","Makowski D., UMR MIA Paris-Saclay, Université Paris-Saclay INRAE AgroParisTech, Palaiseau, 91120, France",,,,,,,"D.

Precise prediction and prompt prevention are crucial in reducing the harm they cause. In this paper we develop a combined machine learning and statistical modelling process to predict fire risk. First, we use random forests and permutation importance techniques to identify the most informative explanatory variables. Second, we design a Poisson point process model and employ logistic regression estimation to estimate the parameters. Moreover, we val-idate the Poisson model assumption using second-order summary statistics and residuals. We implement the modelling process on data collected by the Twente Fire Brigade and obtain plausible predictions. Compared to similar studies, our approach has two advantages: (i) with random forests, we can select explanatory variables nonparametrically considering variable depen-dence; (ii) using logistic regression estimation, we can fit our statistical model efficiently by tuning it to focus on regions and times that are salient for fire risk. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2023.",Fire prediction; K-function; logistic regression estimation; pair correlation function; Poisson point process; spatiotemporal point pattern; variable importance,,Institute of Mathematical Statistics,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85177056622,Ann.

This research strives to comprehensively enhance wildfire prediction and management by implementing various measures to contribute to proactive mitigation in Pakistan. Additionally, the objective of this research was to acquire an extensive understanding of the factors that influence fire patterns in the country. For this purpose, we looked at the spatiotemporal patterns and causes of wildfires between 2000 and 2023 using descriptive analysis. The data analysis included a discussion on density-based clustering as well as the distribution of the data across four seasons over a period of six years. Factors that could indicate the probability of a fire occurrence such as weather conditions, terrain characteristics, and fuel availability encompass details about the soil, economy, and vegetation. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features, and different machine learning (ML) techniques were implemented to obtain the best model for wildfire prediction. The majority of fires in the past six years have primarily occurred during the winter months in coastal locations. The occurrence of fires was accurately predicted by ML models such as random forest (RF), which outperformed competing models. Meanwhile, a CNN with 1D and 2D was used for more improvement in prediction by ML models. The accuracy increased from an 86.48 to 91.34 accuracy score by just using a CNN 1D. For more feature extraction, a CNN 2D was used on the same dataset, which led to state-of-the-art prediction results. A 96.91 accuracy score was achieved by further tuning the RF model on the total data. Data division by spatial and temporal changes was also used for the better prediction of fire, which can further be helpful for understanding the different prospects of wildfire. This research aims to advance wildfire prediction methodologies by leveraging ML techniques to explore the benefits and limitations of capturing complex patterns and relationships in large datasets. Policymakers, environmentalists, and scholars studying climate change can benefit greatly from the study’s analytical approach, which may assist Pakistan in better managing and reducing wildfires. © 2023 by the authors.",CNN; fire occurrence; machine learning; random forest; wildfire assessment,Climate change; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Fires; Forestry; Fuel economy; International cooperation; Large dataset; Machine learning; Statistical tests; Convolutional neural network; Data-driven approach; Environmental conditions; Fire occurrences; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Pakistan; Random forests; Wildfire assessment; Forecasting,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176380049,Remote Sens.,"State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, 230027, China; Department of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, 230027, China","Kanwal R., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, 230027, China; Rafaqat W., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, 230027, China; Iqbal M., Department of Electronic Engineering & Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, 230027, China; Weiguo S., State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, 230027, China",,,,,,,"S.

Professionals forecast that forest fires would raise in the future because of climate change. Early prediction and identification of fire spread would enhance firefighting and reduce affected zones. Several systems have been advanced to detect fire. In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used for tackling this issue because of their ability, high flexibility, and their cheap price to cover vast areas during the nighttime or daytime. But still they are limited by difficulties like image degradation, small fire size, and background complexity. This study develops an automated Forest Fire Detection using Metaheuristics with Deep Learning (FFDMDL-DI) model. The presented FFDMDL-DI technique exploits the DL concepts on drone images to identify the occurrence of fire. To accomplish this, the FFDMDL-DI technique makes use of the Capsule Network (CapNet) model for feature extraction purposes with a biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm-based hyperparameter optimizer. For accurate forest fire detection, the FFDMDL-DI technique uses a unified deep neural network (DNN) model. Finally, the tree growth optimization (TGO) technique is utilized for the parameter adjustment of the DNN method. To depict the enhanced detection efficiency of the FFDMDL-DI approach, a series of simulations were performed. The outcomes reported improvements in the FFDMDL-DI method over other DL models. © 2023 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

The detection of forest fire smoke can provide crucial information for the suppression of early fires. Previous detection models based on deep learning have been limited in detecting small smoke and smoke with smoke-like interference. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model for forest fire smoke detection that is suitable for UAVs. Firstly, a smoke dataset is created from a combination of forest smoke photos obtained through web crawling and enhanced photos generated by using the method of synthesizing smoke. Secondly, the GSELAN and GSSPPFCSPC modules are built based on Ghost Shuffle Convolution (GSConv), which efficiently reduces the number of parameters in the model and accelerates its convergence speed. Next, to address the problem of indistinguishable feature boundaries between clouds and smoke, we integrate coordinate attention (CA) into the YOLO feature extraction network to strengthen the extraction of smoke features and attenuate the background information. Additionally, we use Content-Aware Reassembly of FEatures (CARAFE) upsampling to expand the receptive field in the feature fusion network and fully exploit the semantic information. Finally, we adopt SCYLLA-Intersection over Union (SIoU) loss as a replacement for the original loss function in the prediction phase. This substitution leads to improved convergence efficiency and faster convergence. The experimental results demonstrate that the LMDFS model proposed for smoke detection achieves an accuracy of 80.2% with a 5.9% improvement compared to the baseline and a high number of Frames Per Second (FPS)—63.4. The model also reduces the parameter count by 14% and Giga FLoating-point Operations Per second (GFLOPs) by 6%. These results suggest that the proposed model can achieve a high accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources, making it a promising approach for practical deployment in applications for detecting smoke. © 2023 by the authors.",CARAFE; coordinate attention; deep learning; forest fire smoke detection; Ghost Shuffle Convolution; SIoU; Yolov7,Aircraft detection; Convolution; Deep learning; Deforestation; Extraction; Fires; Image enhancement; Semantics; Content-aware; Content-aware reassembly of feature; Coordinate attention; Deep learning; Forest fire smoke detection; Forest fire smokes; Ghost shuffle convolution; Reassembly; SCYLLA-intersection over union; Smoke detection; Yolov7; Smoke,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167817380,Remote Sens.,"College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; College of Information Management, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China","Chen G., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Cheng R., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Lin X., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Jiao W., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Bai D., College of Information Management, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Lin H., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China",,,,,,,"H.

To reduce the loss of semantic information and improve prediction accuracy, this paper combines dynamic threshold grayscale segmentation and residual network transfer learning. An effective training data extension strategy integrates the experimental data of a real fire platform and a forest-image-based fire database, where the experimental data of the real fire platform are shot based on different lighting and backgrounds. It has been proven that this is a good solution that can effectively solve the problem of training robust deep models relying on datasets with large diversity, which can improve the overall performance of the training model. Then, we introduce a network architecture based on dynamic threshold grayscale segmentation and residual net transfer learning, which reaches residual net level accuracy on image-based fire detection tasks with less computation. We train the model with a self-built image dataset, test it on a general fire image dataset, and evaluate it on a self-built fire video dataset. In numerous experiments, our method produced a training and testing accuracy of 98.26% and 99.90%, respectively, with corresponding losses of 0.036 and 0.04. The evaluation accuracy was 90% under the condition of a complex sample environment. Compared with other models, our method has advantages in accuracy, training loss, and cost time. Comprehensive comparisons show effectiveness and improved overall performance. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; dynamic threshold grayscale segmentation; fire detection; residual network; transfer learning,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176414010,Mathematics,"School of Information Science and Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, 110870, China; College of Civil Aviation Safety Engineering, Civil Aviation Flight University of China, Deyang, 618307, China; School of Public Security Information Technology and Intelligence, Criminal Police University of China, Shenyang, 110035, China","Li H., School of Information Science and Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, 110870, China, College of Civil Aviation Safety Engineering, Civil Aviation Flight University of China, Deyang, 618307, China; Sun P., School of Information Science and Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, 110870, China, School of Public Security Information Technology and Intelligence, Criminal Police University of China, Shenyang, 110035, China",,,,,,,"H.

Fast-spreading wildfires endanger the safety of residents in the wildland-urban interface. To mitigate the hazards of wildfires and facilitate early evacuation, a rapid and accurate forecast of wildfire spread is critical in emergency response. This study proposes a novel dual-model deep learning approach to achieve a super real-time forecast of 2-dimensional wildfire spread in different scenarios. The first model utilizes the U-Net technique to predict the burnt area up to 5 hours in advance. The second model incorporates ConvLSTM layers to refine the forecasted results based on real-time updated input data. To evaluate the effectiveness of this methodology, we applied it to Sunshine Island, Hong Kong, and generated a numerical database consisting of 210 cases (12,600 samples) to train the deep learning models. The simulated wildfire spread database has a fine resolution of 5 m and a time step of 5 minutes. Results show that both models achieve an overall agreement of over 90% between numerical simulation and AI forecast. The real-time wildfire forecasts by AI only take a few seconds, which is 102 ~ 104 times faster than direct simulations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of AI in offering fast and high-resolution forecasts of wildfire spread, and the novel contribution is to leverage two models which can work in tandem and be utilized at various stages of wildfire management. © 2024 ISEIS All rights reserved.",artificial intelligence; fire modelling; prescribed burning; smart firefighting; wildfire prediction; wildland-urban interface,China; Hong Kong; climate change; forecasting method; machine learning; prediction; prescribed burning; real time; safety; wildfire,International Society for Environmental Information Sciences,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195264493,J.

Predicting the occurrence of forest fires can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in China’s forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation, topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel moisture content. In this study, the traditional driving factors of forest fire such as satellite hotspots, vegetation, meteorology, topography and human activities from 2004 to 2021 were introduced along with forest fuel factors (vegetation canopy water content and evapotranspiration from the top of the vegetation canopy), and a database of factors for predicting forest fire occurrence was constructed. And a forest fire occurrence prediction model was built using machine learning methods such as the Random Forest model (RF), the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model (GBDT) and the Adaptive Augmentation Model (AdaBoost). The accuracy of the models was verified using Area Under Curve (AUC) and four other metrics. The RF model with an AUC value of 0.981 was more accurate than all other models in predicting the probability of forest fire occurrence, followed by the GBDT (AUC = 0.978) and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.891) models. The RF model, which has the best accuracy, was selected to predict the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha in 2022 and combined with the Inverse Distance Weight Interpolation method to plot the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha. We found that the monthly spatial and temporal distribution of forest fire probability in Changsha varied significantly, with March, April, May, September, October, November and December being the months with higher forest fire probability. The highest probability of forest fires occurred in the central and northern regions. In this study, the core drivers affecting the occurrence of forest fires in Changsha City were found to be vegetation canopy evapotranspiration and vegetation canopy water content. The RF model was identified as a more suitable forest fire occurrence probability prediction model for Changsha City. Meanwhile, this study found that vegetation characteristics and combustible factors have more influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City than meteorological factors, and surface temperature has less influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City. © 2023 by the authors.",early warning of forest fire risk; forest fire drivers; live fuel moisture content; random forest,Contact angle; Decision trees; Deforestation; Evapotranspiration; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Global warming; Inverse problems; Machine learning; Moisture determination; Probability distributions; Random forests; Topography; Vegetation; Early warning; Early warning of forest fire risk; Fire risks; Forest fire driver; Forest fires; Fuel moisture content; Live fuel moisture; Live fuel moisture content; Random forests; Adaptive boosting,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85170393383,Remote Sens.,"School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China; Yuelushan Laboratory Carbon Sinks Forests Variety Innovation Center, Changsha, 410004, China","Wu X., School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China, Yuelushan Laboratory Carbon Sinks Forests Variety Innovation Center, Changsha, 410004, China; Zhang G., School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China, Yuelushan Laboratory Carbon Sinks Forests Variety Innovation Center, Changsha, 410004, China; Yang Z., School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China, Yuelushan Laboratory Carbon Sinks Forests Variety Innovation Center, Changsha, 410004, China; Tan S., School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China, Yuelushan Laboratory Carbon Sinks Forests Variety Innovation Center, Changsha, 410004, China; Yang Y., School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China, Yuelushan Laboratory Carbon Sinks Forests Variety Innovation Center, Changsha, 410004, China; Pang Z., School of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, China, Yuelushan Laboratory Carbon Sinks Forests Variety Innovation Center, Changsha, 410004, China",,,,,,,"G.

However, this task remains challenging due to the partially stochastic nature of fire behavior and the limited availability of observational data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Herein, we propose an attention-based deep learning modeling approach that can be used to learn the complex behaviors of wildfires across different fire-prone regions. We integrate optimized spatial and channel attention modules with a convolutional neural network (CNN) modeling architecture and train the attention-based fire spread models using a recently derived fire-tracking satellite observational dataset in conjunction with corresponding fuel, terrain, and weather conditions. The evaluation results and their comparison with benchmark models, such as a deeper and more complex autoencoder model and the semi-empirical FARSITE fire behavior model, demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention-based models. These new data-driven fire spread models exhibit promising modeling performances in both the next-step prediction (i.e., predicting fire progression from one timestep earlier) and recursive prediction (i.e., recursively predicting final fire perimeters from initial ignition points) of observed large wildfires in California, and they provide a foundation for further practical applications including short-term active fire spread prediction and long-term fire risk assessment. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; fire risk assessment; remote sensing; wildfire modeling,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169083267,Fire,"Our Kettle Inc, Kensington, 94707, CA, United States; Department of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, 92697, CA, United States; School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, CF10 3AT, United Kingdom; Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, NY, United States","Zou Y., Our Kettle Inc, Kensington, 94707, CA, United States; Sadeghi M., Our Kettle Inc, Kensington, 94707, CA, United States; Liu Y., Our Kettle Inc, Kensington, 94707, CA, United States; Puchko A., Our Kettle Inc, Kensington, 94707, CA, United States; Le S., Our Kettle Inc, Kensington, 94707, CA, United States; Chen Y., Department of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, 92697, CA, United States; Andela N., School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, CF10 3AT, United Kingdom; Gentine P., Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, NY, United States",,,,,,,"Y.

This study integrates deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict potential fire incidents. The research findings can be summarized as follows: (i) The employed model exhibits very good performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.35%, a recall of 86.21%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 87.67%. The application of this model significantly enhances the reliability of the forest fire occurrence model and provides a more precise assessment of its uncertainty. (ii) Spatial analysis shows that the risk of fire occurrence in most areas is low-medium, while high-risk areas are mainly concentrated in Longde County, Jingyuan County, Pengyang County, Xiji County, Yuanzhou District, Tongxin County, Xixia District, and Yinchuan City, which are mostly located in the southern, southeastern, and northwestern regions of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, with a total area of 2191.2 square kilometers. This underscores the urgent need to strengthen early warning systems and effective fire prevention and control strategies in these regions. The contributions of this research include the following: (i) The development of a highly accurate and practical provincial-level forest fire occurrence prediction framework based on grid data and deep learning CNN technology. (ii) The execution of a comprehensive forest fire prediction study in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, incorporating multi-source data, providing valuable data references, and decision support for forest fire prevention and control. (iii) The initiation of a preliminary systematic investigation and zoning of forest fires in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, along with tailored recommendations for prevention and control measures. © 2023 by the authors.",Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); forest fires; geographic distribution; multi-source data; occurrence prediction,Control Systems; Data; Deforestation; Fire Prevention; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Risk Assessment; China; Ningxia Huizu; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Geographical distribution; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Convolutional neural network; Fire occurrences; Forest fires; Geographic distribution; Geographics; Grid data; Multisource data; Occurrence prediction; Prevention and controls; artificial neural network; data; decision support system; forest fire; geographical distribution; machine learning; modeling; prediction; Forecasting,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180646859,Forests,"Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Research Centre of Ecology & Environment for Coastal Area and Deep Sea, Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, 511458, China; School of Ecology, Environment and Resources, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510006, China; College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Zhejiang A & F University, Hangzhou, 311300, China; Planning and Design Office, Ningxia Forestry Survey and Planning Institute, Yinchuan, 750010, China; School of Geographical Sciences, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150028, China; College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China","Shao Y., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Zhu Q., Research Centre of Ecology & Environment for Coastal Area and Deep Sea, Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, 511458, China, School of Ecology, Environment and Resources, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510006, China; Feng Z., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Sun L., College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Zhejiang A & F University, Hangzhou, 311300, China; Yue P., Planning and Design Office, Ningxia Forestry Survey and Planning Institute, Yinchuan, 750010, China; Wang A., School of Geographical Sciences, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150028, China; Zhang X., College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China; Su Z., College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China",,,,,,,"Q.

Wildfire susceptibility assessments have become essential for efficient disaster management and increasing resilience. In this study, we assessed the forest fire susceptibility in Istanbul Province and Thrace Region, Türkiye using a well-known machine learning technique, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Benefiting from freely available Earth Observation datasets such as Sentinel-2 images, Tree Cover Density from European Union (EU) European Environment Agency (EEA) Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, etc., and a forest inventory with ignition locations recorded over a period of eight years, we utilized a total of 16 independent and one dependent variables. The variables can be categorized as anthropogenic, topographic, vegetation, and hydrological factors. A ratio of 1:2 was preferred for the fire/non-fire location samples. The results show that the ANN exhibited high prediction performance with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) value and F-1 score of 0.94 and 0.80, respectively. Based on feature importance analyses, we found that a human-related factor, proximity to forest roads, was the most predictive input variable. The ANN model trained with openly available data (i.e., without forest database) also yielded a high F-1 score, but produced maps with fewer details. Our results confirm that data-driven machine learning methods are promising for regional forest fire susceptibility assessments and can be extended further for other regions by deriving similar parameters from freely available Earth Observation datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial neural network; Earth observation; Forest fire susceptibility assessment; Forest inventory; Spectral indices,Istanbul [Turkey]; Thrace; Turkey; artificial neural network; assessment method; disaster management; EOS; European Union; forest fire; machine learning; spectral analysis,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149312006,Ecol.

The traditional forest fire monitoring is time-consuming and inaccurate, but nighttime light remote sensing is enhancing the efficiency and speed of forest fire detection. Thus, this study focused on forest fire detection in Southwest China that was affected by fires in 2021 and 2022 using daily remote sensing nighttime light data from the black marble product VNP46A2 of the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite. Multiple features were developed based on the temporal features of day-level nighttime light radiances, which were divided into black pixels, stable light pixels, and forest fire pixels using the random forest classification model. To verify the accuracy, a confusion matrix was constructed to calculate the accuracy of the forest fire identification results by combining multisource data, and the results were compared with the results of different machine learning models and fire products. Moreover, the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires was analyzed using trend analysis and nearest-neighbor analysis. Results show that the overall accuracy of pixel classification was over 92% in both years, with forest fire pixels classified with user's accuracy exceeding 99%. The forest fires were mainly dispersed and concentrated around the stable light pixels 400-700 m, and the distribution in different regions showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. Compared with 2021, the distribution of forest fires decreased significantly in 2022. This study can support the future management and protection of forest resources and the prediction of fire disasters. The dataset (2021 and 2022) of forest fires in Southwest China is available free of charge.1 © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Forest fires; nighttime lights (NTLs); random forest classification; Southwest China; spatiotemporal analysis,China; Biological systems; Deforestation; Disasters; Fire hazards; Fires; Learning systems; Pixels; Thermography (imaging); Biological system modeling; Classification models; Forest fires; Land surface; Night time lights; Random forest classification; Random forests; Remote-sensing; Southwest China; Spatiotemporal analysis; algorithm; forest fire; image classification; machine learning; pixel; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; Remote sensing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195384608,IEEE J.

Peatland fire likelihood is crucial as these ecosystems serve as natural fire breaks under normal hydrological conditions but can easily turn into fuel sources under drought conditions. Furthermore, peatland fires have significant implications for atmospheric pollution, releasing fine particulates, carbon, and mercury emissions. Current frameworks for estimating wildfire likelihood predominantly rely on fuel-moisture indices developed for upland environments, which cannot adequately capture the hydrological and fuel-moisture conditions specific to peatlands. Additionally, common fuel-moisture indices are reliant on station-derived meteorological data, which are scarce in remote areas and therefore imprecise over large portions of sub-Arctic Canada and the boreal forest. Remote sensing data represents a proxy for near real-time surface conditions for remote locations, such as moisture and vegetation, where a time series of remotely-sensed metrics provides information about patterns and trends in local conditions over longer periods. With this in mind, we used SAR (Sentinel-1), multispectral (Sentinel-2) and human infrastructure data as a predictor of wildfire probability in treed peatlands of Canada. We developed a fire probability model based on metrics drawn from a seasonally decomposed time series of SAR backscatter and common multispectral indices of greenness, soil moisture and vegetation moisture. Sample sites were derived from an existing treed peatland map, then the Canadian Forest Service National Burned Area Composite dataset was used to identify fire events within those areas. This study presents a robust and versatile framework for training fire probability models that leverage remote sensing data and temporally-invariant ancillary predictors. Fire probability in peatland locations, given current conditions, was predicted through a model algorithm called extreme gradient boosting. To obtain fire probabilities over a four-week timeframe, the output of the binary classifier was calibrated, transforming its raw scores into more accurate probabilities. This approach showcases the effectiveness of machine learning methods in harnessing seasonally-decomposed remotely sensed time-series to improve fire prediction. The most important predictors of fire likelihood in treed peatlands were found to be multispectral moisture-related indices (Tasseled cap Wetness and Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and the distance to human infrastructure, which may indicate an overrepresentation of human-caused fires in the predictions. Using subsets of predictors, different iterations of the model demonstrate that incorporating SAR backscatter data can enhance the accuracy of fire likelihood predictions. However, models relying solely on SAR data exhibited lower performance, indicating limited applicability of SAR backscatter in treed peatlands without more advanced filtering and a correction method. The fire likelihood model presented here adds seasonally-detrended time series metrics from remote sensing observations to inform fire risk, independent from meteorological data. Such models could be implemented for a near-real time assessment of fire conditions that could complement the existing framework for fire risk predictions in Canada. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",,Canada; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Time series; Vegetation mapping; Wetlands; %moisture; 'current; Fire risks; Fuel moisture; Moisture index; Peat land; Remote-sensing; SAR backscatter; Surface conditions; Times series; algorithm; data set; drought; machine learning; peatland; remote sensing; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; vegetation dynamics; Fires,Elsevier Inc.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166902333,Remote Sens.

The factors which determine wildfire growth rates are complex and depend on numerous meteorological factors, topography, and fuel loads. In this paper, we have built upon previous studies that have mapped daily burned areas at the individual fire level around the globe. We applied several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron to predict daily fire growth rate based on meteorological factors, topography, and fuel loads. Our best model on the entire dataset obtained a 1.15 km2 MAE. The ML model obtained a 90% accuracy when predicting whether a fire’s growth rate will increase or decrease the following day, compared to 61% using a logistic regression. We discuss the central factors that determine wildfire growth rate. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to perform such analyses on a global dataset. © 2023 by the authors.",fire growth rate; fire weather; machine learning; wildfires,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168936316,Fire,"Department of Geophysics, Porter School of the Environment and Earth Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel","Shmuel A., Department of Geophysics, Porter School of the Environment and Earth Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel; Heifetz E., Department of Geophysics, Porter School of the Environment and Earth Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel",,,,,,,"A.

Catastrophic crown fires in these forests are fueled predominantly by only two evergreen needle-leaf tree species, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.). Identifying where these flammable species grow through time in the landscape is critical for understanding wildfire risk, damages, and human exposure. Because medium resolution landcover data that include species detail are lacking, we developed a compound modeling approach that enabled us to refine the available evergreen forest category into highly flammable species and less flammable species. We then expanded our refined landcover at decadal time steps from 1984 to 2014. With the aid of an existing burn model, FlamMap, and simple succession rules, we were able to predict future landcover at decadal steps until 2054. Our resulting land covers provide important information to communities in our study area on current and future wildfire risk and vegetation changes and could be developed in a similar fashion for other areas. © 2023 by the authors.",boreal forest; interior Alaska; machine learning model; wildfire; Yukon,Fires; Flammability; Forecasts; Forestry; Plants; Yukon; Alaska; Canada; United States; Yukon Territory; Fires; Flammability; Forecasting; Forestry; Machine learning; Black spruce (Picea mariana); Boreal forests; Crown fires; Interior alaska; Land cover; Machine learning models; Tree species; Wildfire; Wildfire risks; Yukon; evergreen forest; land cover; machine learning; prediction; succession; vegetation dynamics; wildlife management; Vegetation,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168801381,Forests,"Environmental Studies, Soka University of America, Aliso Viejo, 92656, CA, United States; Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, 99508, AK, United States; Math/Science, Soka University of America, Aliso Viejo, 92656, CA, United States; Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, 99775, AK, United States","Calef M.P., Environmental Studies, Soka University of America, Aliso Viejo, 92656, CA, United States; Schmidt J.I., Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, 99508, AK, United States; Varvak A., Math/Science, Soka University of America, Aliso Viejo, 92656, CA, United States; Ziel R., Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, 99775, AK, United States",,,,,,,"M.P.

The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator - INteractive Fire and Emissions algorithm for Natural envirOnments (JULES-INFERNO) is a global land surface model, which simulates vegetation, soils, and fire occurrence driven by environmental factors. However, this model incurs substantial computational costs due to the high data dimensionality and the complexity of differential equations. Deep-learning-based digital twins have an advantage in handling large amounts of data. They can reduce the computational cost of subsequent predictive models by extracting data features through reduced-order modelling (ROM) and then compressing the data to a low-dimensional latent space. This study proposes a JULES-INFERNO-based digital twin fire model using ROM techniques and deep learning prediction networks to improve the efficiency of global wildfire predictions. The iterative prediction implemented in the proposed model can use current-year data to predict fires in subsequent years. To avoid the accumulation of errors from the iterative prediction, latent data assimilation (LA) is applied to the prediction process. LA manages to efficiently adjust the prediction results to ensure the stability and sustainability of the prediction. Numerical results show that the proposed model can effectively encode the original data and achieve accurate surrogate predictions. Furthermore, the application of LA can also effectively adjust the bias of the prediction results. The proposed digital twin also runs 500 times faster for online predictions than the original JULES-INFERNO model without requiring high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.  © 2023 Caili Zhong et al.",,data assimilation; equation; forest fire; machine learning; numerical model; prediction,Copernicus Publications,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160915402,Nat.

Understanding the dynamics of forest fires is crucial, especially in high-incidence regions. In this work, we apply deep networks to simulate the spatiotemporal progression of the area burnt in a forest fire. We tackle the region interpolation problem challenge by using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) model and generate in-between representations on the evolution of the burnt area. We also apply a CVAE model to forecast the progression of fire propagation, estimating the burnt area at distinct horizons and propagation stages. We evaluate our approach against other established techniques using real-world data. The results demonstrate that our method is competitive in geometric similarity metrics and exhibits superior temporal consistency for in-between representation generation. In the context of burnt area forecasting, our approach achieves scores of 90% for similarity and 99% for temporal consistency. These findings suggest that CVAE models may be a viable alternative for modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of 2D moving regions of forest fire evolution. © The Author(s) 2024.",Conditional variational autoencoders; Deep learning; Forecasting; Region interpolation; Spatiotemporal data,Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Interpolation; Learning systems; Auto encoders; Burnt areas; Conditional variational autoencoder; Deep learning; Fire dynamics; Forest fires; Model forests; Region interpolation; Spatio-temporal data; Temporal consistency; Forecasting,Springer,Article,Article in press,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196752786,Inf.

This study introduces an enhanced window-based Transformer time series forecasting model aimed at improving the precision of forest fire predictions. Leveraging time series data from 2020 to 2021 in Chongli, a myriad of forest fire influencing factors were ascertained using remote sensing satellite and GIS technologies, with their interrelationships estimated through a multicollinearity test. Given the intricate nature of real-world forest fire prediction tasks, we propose a novel window-based Transformer architecture complemented by a dual time series input strategy premised on 13 influential factors. Subsequently, time series data were incorporated into the model to generate a forest fire risk prediction map in Chongli District. The model’s effectiveness was then evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy (ACC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and compared with traditional deep learning methods. Our model demonstrated superior predictive performance (ACC = 91.56%, RMSE = 0.37, MAE = 0.05), harnessing spatial background information efficiently and effectively utilizing the periodicity of forest fire factors. Consequently, the study proves this method to be a novel and potent approach for time series fire prediction. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; forest fire; transformer; wildfire,Deforestation; Disasters; Fires; Forecasts; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Deep learning; Deforestation; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Deep learning; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Mean absolute error; Root mean square errors; Time-series data; Times series; Transformer; Wildfire; Window-based; forest fire; GIS; machine learning; mapping method; prediction; remote sensing; time series analysis; wildfire; Time series,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168792368,Forests,"College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Department of Criminal Investigation, Nanjing Forest Police College, Nanjing, 210023, China; Institute of Meteorological Sciences of Jilin Province, Changchun, 130062, China; National Satellite Meteorological Center, Beijing, 100081, China; School of Design Arts and Media, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China","Miao X., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Li J., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Mu Y., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; He C., Department of Criminal Investigation, Nanjing Forest Police College, Nanjing, 210023, China; Ma Y., Institute of Meteorological Sciences of Jilin Province, Changchun, 130062, China; Chen J., National Satellite Meteorological Center, Beijing, 100081, China; Wei W., School of Design Arts and Media, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210094, China; Gao D., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China",,,,,,,"D.

An Internet of Things (IoT) system was developed to measure and collect fire risk factors in the Raja Musa Forest Reserve (RMFR) in Selangor, Malaysia, to address this issue. In this paper, neural networks with different layers were employed to predict peatland forests’ Fire Weather Index (FWI). The neural network models used two sets of input parameters, consisting of four and nine fire factors. The predicted FWI values were compared with actual values obtained from the Malaysian meteorological department. The findings revealed that the five-layer neural network outperformed others in both the four-input and nine-input models. Specifically, the nine-input neural network achieved a mean square error (MSE) of 1.116 and a correlation of 0.890, surpassing the performance of the four-input neural network with the MSE of 1.537 and the correlation of 0.852. These results hold significant research and practical implications for precise peatland fire prevention, control, and the formulation of preventive measures. © 2023 by the authors.",fire prediction; IoT measurement; machine learning; neural network; peatland,Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Risk Assessment; Wetlands; Malaysia; Selangor; West Malaysia; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Forecasting; Internet of things; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Risk assessment; Wetlands; Fire prediction; Fire risks; Fire weather index; Forest fires; Internet of thing measurement; Machine-learning; Malaysia; Means square errors; Neural-networks; Peat land; forest fire; Internet; machine learning; peatland; prediction; Mean square error,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166260317,Forests,"Wireless and Photonics Networks Research Centre of Excellence (WiPNET), Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Malaysia","Li L., Wireless and Photonics Networks Research Centre of Excellence (WiPNET), Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Malaysia; Sali A., Wireless and Photonics Networks Research Centre of Excellence (WiPNET), Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Malaysia; Noordin N.K., Wireless and Photonics Networks Research Centre of Excellence (WiPNET), Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Malaysia; Ismail A., Wireless and Photonics Networks Research Centre of Excellence (WiPNET), Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Malaysia; Hashim F., Wireless and Photonics Networks Research Centre of Excellence (WiPNET), Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, 43400, Malaysia",,,,,,,"L.

Ensemble learning methods can avoid the problem of difficult model selection for disaster susceptibility prediction and can significantly improve modeling accuracy. This study introduces a stacking ensemble learning model for predicting forest fire risks in Yunnan Province by integrating various data types, such as meteorological, topographic, vegetation, and human activity factors. A total of 70,274 fire points and an equal number of randomly selected nonfire points were used to develop the model, with 70% of the data allocated for training and the remaining 30% for testing. The stacking model combined four diverse machine learning methods: random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We evaluated the model’s predictive performance using metrics like accuracy, area under the characteristic curve (AUC), and fire density (FD). The results demonstrated that the stacking fusion model exhibited remarkable accuracy with an AUC of 0.970 on the test set, significantly surpassing the performance of individual machine learning models, which had AUC values ranging from 0.935 to 0.953. Furthermore, the stacking fusion model effectively captured the maximum fire density in extremely high susceptibility areas, demonstrating enhanced generalization capabilities. © 2023 by the authors.",ensemble learning; fire susceptibility map; forest fire risk; machine learning; prediction; stacking model,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183098950,Fire,"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China; Tianjin Fire Science and Technology Research Institute of MEM, Tianjin, 300381, China; College of Information Engineering, Dalian University, Dalian, 116622, China; Department of Fire Protection Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 611756, China","Li Y., College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China, Tianjin Fire Science and Technology Research Institute of MEM, Tianjin, 300381, China; Li G., Tianjin Fire Science and Technology Research Institute of MEM, Tianjin, 300381, China; Wang K., College of Information Engineering, Dalian University, Dalian, 116622, China; Wang Z., College of Information Engineering, Dalian University, Dalian, 116622, China; Chen Y., Department of Fire Protection Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 611756, China",,,,,,,"K.

Satellite imagery platforms, in particular geostationary satellites with high temporal resolution, allow for real-time fire monitoring. However, because of the coarse resolution of geostationary satellite images, even when deep learning models are applied, precision still remains limited. Thus, the prediction models easily fall into a local optimal solution because of the insufficient semantic information from low spatial resolution. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a novel deep learning model, SBT-FireNet, to monitor fire spots from Himawari-8 satellite images. Specifically, the extraction modules of spatial, band, and time-series features were designed and integrated into the model. The spatial feature extraction module served to collate information about fires and their surrounding environment, while the band and time-series features were designed to obtain fire-sensitive band and time information, respectively. The newly structured SBT-FireNet model was tested in four fire-prone areas with high forest cover. The precision of SBT-FireNet in four test areas is 35.2% higher than other methods. The model yielded significant improvements through the combination of the modules of spatial, band, and time-series features and their fire-tailored design. The advantages of the high temporal resolution of geostationary satellite images were fully integrated into the model to ensure that the model monitors the possibility of fire in an automated way in a near-real-time manner.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; LSTM; near-real-time monitoring; transformer; wildfire,Extraction; Forestry; Geostationary satellites; Long short-term memory; Satellite imagery; Semantics; Time series; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; High temporal resolution; LSTM; Near-real-time monitoring; Satellite images; Time series features; Transformer; Wildfire; artificial neural network; image analysis; image classification; machine learning; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; Fires,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181660950,IEEE J.

Forecasting wildfire danger and uncovering the drivers behind fire events become central for understanding relevant climate-land surface feedback and aiding wildfire management. In this work, we leverage Deep Learning (DL) to predict the next day's wildfire danger in a fire-prone part of the Eastern Mediterranean and explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) to diagnose model attributions. We implement DL models that capture the temporal and spatio-temporal context, generalize well for extreme wildfires, and demonstrate improved performance over the traditional Fire Weather Index. Leveraging xAI, we identify the substantial contribution of wetness-related variables and unveil the temporal focus of the models. The variability of the contribution of the input variables across wildfire events hints into different wildfire mechanisms. The presented methodology paves the way to more robust, accurate, and trustworthy data-driven anticipation of wildfires. © 2022 The Authors.",Deep Learning; explainable AI; fire; Machine Learning; wildfires,Climate change; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Danger prediction; Deep learning; Explainable AI; Fire event; Heatwaves; Land surface; Machine-learning; Occurences; Wildfire; Wildfire management; artificial intelligence; climate change; climate effect; climate feedback; frequency analysis; heat wave; performance assessment; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; Fires,John Wiley and Sons Inc,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138096305,Geophys.

However, representation of the wildfire-climate relationship remains challenging due to spatiotemporally heterogenous responses of wildfires to climate variability and human influences. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) fire model (AttentionFire_v1.0) to resolve the complex controls of climate and human activities on burned areas and to better predict burned areas over ASA regions. Our ML fire model substantially improved predictability of burned areas for both spatial and temporal dynamics compared with five commonly used machine learning models. More importantly, the model revealed strong time-lagged control from climate wetness on the burned areas. The model also predicted that, under a high-emission future climate scenario, the recently observed declines in burned area will reverse in South America in the near future due to climate changes. Our study provides a reliable and interpretable fire model and highlights the importance of lagged wildfire-climate relationships in historical and future predictions.  © 2023 Fa Li et al.",,Africa; South America; anthropogenic effect; climate change; human activity; machine learning; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire,Copernicus Publications,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147904934,Geoscientific Model Dev.,"Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States; State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States; Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States; Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","Li F., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States, State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Zhu Q., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States; Riley W.J., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States; Zhao L., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States; Xu L., Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States; Yuan K., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States, State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Chen M., Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States; Wu H., State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Gui Z., School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Gong J., School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Randerson J.T., Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States",,,,,,,"Q.

To model the probability of the occurrence of forest fires in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship of Poland, historical fire data and several types of predictors were collected or generated, including topographic, vegetation, climatic, and anthropogenic features. The main objectives of this study were to determine the importance of the predictors of forest fire occurrence and to map the probability of forest fire occurrence. The H2O driverless artificial intelligence (DAI) cloud platform was used to model forest fire probability. The gradient boosted machine (GBM) and random forest (RF) methods were applied to assess the probability of forest fire occurrence. Evaluation the importance of the variables was performed using the H2O platform permutation method. The most important variables were the presence of coniferous forest and the distance to agricultural land according to the GBM and RF methods, respectively. Model validation was conducted using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the ROC plots from the GBM and RF models were 83.3% and 81.3%, respectively. Based on the results obtained, the GBM model can be recommended for the mapping of forest fire occurrence in the study area. © 2022 by the authors.",forest fire; gradient boosted machine; ignition probability; random forest,Central Europe; Deforestation; Forest Fires; Machinery; Mapping; Methods; Probability; Lower Silesia; Poland [Central Europe]; Silesia; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Central Europe; Fire occurrences; Forest fires; Gradient boosted machine; Historical fire data; Ignition probability; Machine learning methods; On-machines; Random forest methods; Random forests; agricultural land; computer simulation; coniferous forest; fire behavior; fire history; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; mapping method; modeling; numerical model; prediction; probability; topographic effect; Mapping,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146784466,Forests,"Department of Forestry, Faculty of Forestry, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, 11030, Serbia; Department of Forest Protection and Wildlife Management, Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology, Mendel University in Brno, Brno, 613 00, Czech Republic; General Directorate of the State Forests, Warsaw, 02-124, Poland; Department of Geomatics, Forest Research Institute, Sękocin Stary, 05-090, Poland; Department of Forest and Soil Sciences, Institute of Silviculture, University of Natural and Life Sciences, Vienna, 1190, Austria; Forest Fire Protection Laboratory, Forest Research Institute, Sękocin Stary, 05-090, Poland; Prevent Fires Foundation, Warsaw, 02-124, Poland; Department of Forest Management, Dendrometry and Forest Economics, Institute of Forest Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences—SGGW, Warsaw, 02-124, Poland; Department for Biomechanics, Biomedical Engineering and Physics of Complex Systems, Institute for Medical Research, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia","Milanović S., Department of Forestry, Faculty of Forestry, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, 11030, Serbia, Department of Forest Protection and Wildlife Management, Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology, Mendel University in Brno, Brno, 613 00, Czech Republic; Kaczmarowski J., General Directorate of the State Forests, Warsaw, 02-124, Poland; Ciesielski M., Department of Geomatics, Forest Research Institute, Sękocin Stary, 05-090, Poland; Trailović Z., Department of Forest and Soil Sciences, Institute of Silviculture, University of Natural and Life Sciences, Vienna, 1190, Austria; Mielcarek M., Department of Geomatics, Forest Research Institute, Sękocin Stary, 05-090, Poland; Szczygieł R., Forest Fire Protection Laboratory, Forest Research Institute, Sękocin Stary, 05-090, Poland; Kwiatkowski M., Forest Fire Protection Laboratory, Forest Research Institute, Sękocin Stary, 05-090, Poland; Bałazy R., Prevent Fires Foundation, Warsaw, 02-124, Poland; Zasada M., Department of Forest Management, Dendrometry and Forest Economics, Institute of Forest Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences—SGGW, Warsaw, 02-124, Poland; Milanović S.D., Department for Biomechanics, Biomedical Engineering and Physics of Complex Systems, Institute for Medical Research, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia",,,,,,,"S.

Several models proposed for the prediction of their occurrence and behavior have aimed at identifying their conditioning factors, risks, and post-effects. However, their application in other regions is impracticable or very difficult, due to the distinct geographic characteristics of the areas and the unavailability of data. This research is devoted to the prediction of both spread and behavior of wildfires at a specific time and/or in specific regions for helping fire management agencies minimize the damages caused. The Brazilian Federal District, inserted in the Cerrado biome, is the focus of the analyses, due to its large number of fire occurrences and reduced number of studies conducted on the region. A dataset was compiled from Brazilian governmental open data for the prediction of the wildfire behavior and used for the training of several Machine Learning models that consider the fire point of ignition to predict the areas that will be impacted. It includes observations on climate features from 5 monitoring stations and satellite data on fires that occurred over the past two decades and was enriched with other topographic, hydrographic, and anthropogenic features, such as urbanization index, distance to rivers/roads, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). According to the results, AdaBoost model predicted the area affected by the wildfire with 91% accuracy, showing better performance than Random Forest (RF) 88%, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 86%, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 81%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",ADABoost; Artificial neural networks; Behavior; Climatic; Machine learning; Performance; Prediction; Random forest; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Wildfires,Adaptive boosting; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Random forests; Support vector machines; Behavior; Behavioural studies; Climatic; Forest fires; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Random forests; Support vectors machine; Wildfire; Vegetation,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143812596,Eng Appl Artif Intell,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia DF, Zip code 70910-900, Brazil","Rubí J.N.S., Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia DF, Zip code 70910-900, Brazil; de Carvalho P.H.P., Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia DF, Zip code 70910-900, Brazil; Gondim P.R.L., Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia DF, Zip code 70910-900, Brazil",EAAIE,,,,,,"J.N.S.

Existing models mainly adopt regular grids or fire perimeters to describe the wildfire landscape. However, these models have difficulty in explicitly demonstrating the local spread details, especially in a complex landscape. In this paper, we propose a wildfire spread model with an irregular graph network (IGN). This model implemented an IGN generation algorithm to characterize the wildland landscape with a variable scale, adaptively encoding complex regions with dense nodes and simple regions with sparse nodes. Then, a deep learning-based spread model is designed to calculate the spread duration of each graph edge under variable environmental conditions. Comparative experiments between the IGN model and widely used fire simulation models were conducted on a real wildfire in Getty, California, USA. The results show that the IGN model can accurately and explicitly describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of the wildfire spread in a novel graph form while maintaining competitive simulation refinement and computational efficiency (Jaccard: 0.587, SM: 0.740, OA: 0.800). © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; emergency rescue; irregular graph network; variable scale; wildfire spread,,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144653927,Fire,"Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Institute of Safety Science and Technology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518000, China; Foshan Urban Safety Research Center, Foshan, 528000, China; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430000, China","Jiang W., Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, Institute of Safety Science and Technology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518000, China; Wang F., Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, Institute of Safety Science and Technology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518000, China; Su G., Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Li X., Foshan Urban Safety Research Center, Foshan, 528000, China; Wang G., Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Zheng X., Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, Institute of Safety Science and Technology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518000, China; Wang T., Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China, Institute of Safety Science and Technology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518000, China; Meng Q., School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430000, China",,,,,,,"F.

It is vital to quantify and map the controlling drivers of wildfires for effective wildfire prediction and risk management. However, high-resolution mapping of wildfire drivers remains challenging. Here we established machine-learning (Random Forests) models using 23 climate and land surface variables as model inputs to reconstruct the spatial variability and seasonality of wildfire occurrence and extent in California. The importance of individual drivers was then quantified based on the Shapley value method. Thus, we provided spatially resolved maps of wildfire drivers at high resolutions up to 0.004° × 0.004°. The results indicated that precipitation and soil moisture are the major drivers dominating 37% of the total burnt area for large and extreme wildfires in summer and 63% in autumn, while elevation plays a major role for 15–58% of burnt areas in small wildfires in all seasons. Winds are also an important contributor to summer wildfires, accounting for 41% of large and extreme burnt areas. This study enhanced our knowledge of spatial variability of wildfire drivers across diverse landscapes in a fine-scale mapping, providing valuable perspectives and case studies for other regions of the world with frequently occurred wildfire. © 2021",Machine learning methods; Precipitation and soil moisture; Shapley value method; Wildfire drivers; Wildfire occurrence and extent,California; Ecosystem; Humans; Machine Learning; Wildfires; California; United States; Climate models; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Fires; Game theory; Machine learning; Mapping; Risk management; Burnt areas; California; High-resolution mapping; Machine learning methods; Precipitation and soil moisture; Shapley value; Shapley value method; Value methods; Wildfire driver; Wildfire occurrence and extent; land surface; machine learning; mapping; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; soil moisture; spatial variation; wildfire; article; autumn; California; climate; human; machine learning; precipitation; quantitative analysis; random forest; seasonal variation; soil moisture; summer; wildfire; California; ecosystem; machine learning; Soil moisture,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128303453,Sci.

They pose an ongoing challenge in scientific and forest management. Predicting forest fires improves the levels of forest-fire prevention and risk avoidance. This study aimed to construct a forest risk map for China. We base our map on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data from 17,330 active fires for the period 2012–2019, and combined terrain, meteorology, social economy, vegetation, and other factors closely related to the generation of forest-fire disasters for modeling and predicting forest fires. Four machine learning models for predicting forest fires were compared (i.e., random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm), and the RF model was chosen (its accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC values were 87.99%, 85.94%, 91.51%, 88.64% and 95.11% respectively). The Chinese seasonal fire zoning map was drawn with the municipal administrative unit as the spatial scale for the first time. The results show evident seasonal and regional differences in the Chinese forest-fire risks; forest-fire risks are relativity high in the spring and winter, but low in fall and summer, and the areas with high regional fire risk are mainly in the provinces of Yunnan (including the cities of Qujing, Lijiang, and Yuxi), Guangdong (including the cities of Shaoguan, Huizhou, and Qingyuan), and Fujian (including the cities of Nanping and Sanming). The major contributions of this study are to (i) provide a framework for large-scale forest-fire risk prediction having a low cost, high precision, and ease of operation, and (ii) improve the understanding of forest-fire risks in China. © 2022 by the authors.

We assessed the susceptibility of forests to fire in India by comparing six machine learning (ML) algorithms. We identified the best-suited ML algorithms for triggering a fire prediction model, using minimal parameters related to forests, climate and topography. Specifically, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire hotspots from 2001 to 2020 as training data. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC/AUC) for the prediction rate showed that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (ROC/AUC = 0.908) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (ROC/AUC = 0.903) show excellent performance. By and large, our results showed that north-east and central India and the lower Himalayan regions were highly susceptible to forest fires. Importantly, the significance of this study lies in the fact that it is possibly among the first to predict forest fire susceptibility in the Indian context, using an integrated approach comprising ML, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Climate Engine (CE).  © 2022 CSIRO.

The prediction of forest fires is vital for preventing their occurrence. Currently, there are fewer studies on the prediction of forest fires over longer time scales in China. This is due to the difficulty of forecasting forest fires. There are many factors that have an impact on the occurrence of forest fires. The specific contribution of each factor to the occurrence of forest fires is not clear when using conventional analyses. In this study, we leveraged the excellent performance of artificial intelligence algorithms in fusing data from multiple sources (e.g., fire hotspots, meteorological conditions, terrain, vegetation, and socioeconomic data collected from 2003 to 2016). We have tested several algorithms and, finally, four algorithms were selected for formal data processing. There were an artificial neural network, a radial basis function network, a support-vector machine, and a random forest to identify thirteen major drivers of forest fires in China. The models were evaluated using the five performance indicators of accuracy, precision, recall, f1 value, and area under the curve. We obtained the probability of forest fire occurrence in each province of China using the optimal model. Moreover, the spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas was mapped. The results showed that the prediction accuracies of the four forest fire prediction models were between 75.8% and 89.2%, and the area under the curve (AUC) values were between 0.840 and 0.960. The random forest model had the highest accuracy (89.2%) and AUC value (0.96). It was determined as the best performance model in this study. The prediction results indicate that the areas with high incidences of forest fires are mainly concentrated in north-eastern China (Heilongjiang Province and northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) and south-eastern China (including Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province). In areas at high risk of forest fire, management departments should improve forest fire prevention and control by establishing watch towers and using other monitoring equipment. This study helped in understanding the main drivers of forest fires in China over the period between 2003 and 2016, and determined the best performance model. The spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas maps were produced in order to depict the comprehensive views of China’s forest fire risks in each province. They were expected to form a scientific basis for helping the decision-making of China’s forest fire prevention authorities. © 2022 by the authors.",feature selection; forest fire driving factors; forest fire occurrence; machine learning; prediction model,Data handling; Decision trees; Deforestation; Feature extraction; Fire hazards; Fires; Radial basis function networks; Random forests; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Areas under the curves; Driving factors; Features selection; Fire occurrences; Forest fire driving factor; Forest fire occurrence; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Forecasting,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141881296,Remote Sens.,"Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Beijing Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Beijing, 100038, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modelling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Department of Resource Management, Tangshan Normal University, Tangshan, 063000, China","Pang Y., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Li Y., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China, Beijing Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Beijing, 100038, China; Feng Z., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Feng Z., Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modelling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Zhao Z., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China, Department of Resource Management, Tangshan Normal University, Tangshan, 063000, China; Chen S., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Zhang H., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China",,,,,,,"Z.

An in-depth understanding of the combined mechanisms of factors affecting the occurrence and spread of bushfires is needed to support the development of effective fire prevention plans and fire suppression measures and aid planning for geographic, ecological maintenance and urban emergency management. This study aimed to explore how bushfires, meteorological variability and other natural factors have interacted over the past 40 years in NSW Australia and how these influencing factors synergistically drive bushfires. The CSIRO’s Spark toolkit has been used to simulate bushfire burning spread over 24 h. The study uses NSW wildfire data from 1981–2020, combined with meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation, wind speed), vegetation data (NDVI data, vegetation type) and topography (slope, soil moisture) data to analyse the relationship between bushfires and influencing factors quantitatively. Machine learning-random forest regression was then used to determine the differences in the influence of bushfire factors on the incidence and burn scale of bushfires. Finally, the data on each influence factor was imported into Spark, and the results of the random forest model were used to set different influence weights in Spark to visualise the spread of bushfires burning over 24 h in four hotspot regions of bushfire in NSW. Wind speed, air temperature and soil moisture were found to have the most significant influence on the spread of bushfires, with the combined contribution of these three factors exceeding 60%, determining the spread of bushfires and the scale of burning. Precipitation and vegetation showed a greater influence on the annual frequency of bushfires. In addition, burn simulations show that wind direction influences the main direction of fire spread, whereas the shape of the flame front is mainly due to the influence of land classification. Besides, the simulation results from Spark could predict the temporal and spatial spread of fire, which is a potential decision aid for fireproofing agencies. The results of this study can inform how fire agencies can better understand fire occurrence mechanisms and use bushfire prediction and simulation techniques to support both their operational (short-term) and strategic (long-term) fire management responses and policies. © 2022 by the authors.

Many researchers use machine learning techniques to predict forest fires by considering spatio-temporal data features. However, it is difficult to efficiently obtain the features from large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous data. There is a lack of a method that can effectively extract features required by machine learning-based forest fire predictions from multi-source spatio-temporal data. This paper proposes a forest fire prediction method that integrates spatio-temporal knowledge graphs and machine learning models. This method can fuse multi-source heterogeneous spatio-temporal forest fire data by constructing a forest fire semantic ontology and a knowledge graph-based spatio-temporal framework. This paper defines the domain expertise of forest fire analysis as the semantic rules of the knowledge graph. This paper proposes a rule-based reasoning method to obtain the corresponding data for the specific machine learning-based forest fire prediction methods, which are dedicated to tackling the problem with real-time prediction scenarios. This paper performs experiments regarding forest fire predictions based on real-world data in the experimental areas Xichang and Yanyuan in Sichuan province. The results show that the proposed method is beneficial for the fusion of multi-source spatio-temporal data and highly improves the prediction performance in real forest fire prediction scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.",forest fire prediction; knowledge graph; machine learning; multi-source heterogeneous data fusion; spatio-temporal data,Data fusion; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Machine learning; Semantics; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Heterogeneous data; Knowledge graphs; Machine-learning; Multi-source heterogeneous data fusion; Multi-Sources; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal data; Temporal knowledge; Forecasting,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137147062,Remote Sens.,"Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China; College of Resources and Environment (CRE), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China","Ge X., Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China, College of Resources and Environment (CRE), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; Yang Y., Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; Peng L., Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China, College of Resources and Environment (CRE), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; Chen L., Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China, College of Resources and Environment (CRE), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; Li W., Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China; Zhang W., Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China, College of Resources and Environment (CRE), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China; Chen J., Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100094, China, College of Resources and Environment (CRE), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China",,,,,,,"L.

Unprecedented fire events such as Australia's bushfires have alerted us to the fact that wildfire prediction is a critical scientific problem for fire management. Therefore, robust, long-lead models and dynamic predictions of wildfire are valuable for global fire prevention. However, despite decades of effort, the dynamic, effective, and accurate prediction of wildfire remains problematic. There is great uncertainty in predicting the future based on historical and existing spatiotemporal sequence data, but with advances in deep learning algorithms, solutions to prediction problems are being developed. Here, we present a dynamic prediction model of global burned area of wildfire employing a deep neural network (DNN) approach that produces effective wildfire forecasts based on historical time series predictors and satellite-based burned area products. A hybrid DNN that combines long short-term memory and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN2D-LSTM) was proposed, and CNN2D-LSTM model candidates with four different architectures were designed and compared to construct the optimal architecture for fire prediction. The proposed model was also shown to outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the fully connected long short-term memory (FcLSTM) approach using the refined index of agreement and evaluation metrics. We produced monthly global burned area spatiotemporal prediction maps and adequately reflected the seasonal peak in fire activity and highly fire-prone areas. Our combined CNN2D-LSTM approach can effectively predict the global burned area of wildfires 1 month in advance and can be generalized to provide seasonal estimates of global fire risk. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.",convolutional neural network; deep neural network; dynamic prediction; long short-term memory neural network; monthly burned area; wildfire,"Fires; Forecasting; Forests; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Wildfires; Australia; artificial neural network; prediction; seasonal variation; wildfire; fire; forecasting; forest; human; wildfire",Ecological Society of America,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131158890,Ecol.

Thus, fire smoke detection is important for early fire detection. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used to detect fire smoke in satellite imagery for fire detection. However, previous DL-based research only considered lower spatial resolution sensors (e.g., Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and only used the visible (i.e., red, green, blue (RGB)) bands. To contribute towards solutions for early fire smoke detection, we constructed a six-band imagery dataset from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) with a 30-metre spatial resolution. The dataset consists of 1836 images in three classes, namely “Smoke”, “Clear”, and “Other_aerosol”. To prepare for potential on-board-of-small-satellite detection, we designed a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model named “Variant Input Bands for Smoke Detection (VIB_SD)”, which achieved competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art model SAFA, with less than 2% of its number of parameters. We further investigated the impact of using additional Infra-Red (IR) bands on the accuracy of fire smoke detection with VIB_SD by training it with five different band combinations. The results demonstrated that adding the Near-Infra-Red (NIR) band improved prediction accuracy compared with only using the visible bands. Adding both Short-Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands can further improve the model performance compared with adding only one SWIR band. The case study showed that the model trained with multispectral bands could effectively detect fire smoke mixed with cloud over small geographic extents. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, forest-fire-risk prediction was studied based on random forest (RF) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. The Heihe area of Heilongjiang Province is one of the key forest areas and forest-fire-prone areas in China. Based on daily historical forest-fire data from 1995 to 2015, daily meteorological data, topographic data and basic geographic information data, the main forest-fire driving factors were first analyzed by using RF importance characteristic evaluation and logistic stepwise regression. Then, the prediction models were established by using the two machine learning methods. Furthermore, the goodness of fit of the models was tested using the receiver operating characteristic test method. Finally, the fire-risk grades were divided by applying the kriging method. The results showed that 11 driving factors were significantly correlated with forest-fire occurrence, and days after the last rain, daily average relative humidity, daily maximum temperature, daily average water vapor pressure, daily minimum relative humidity and distance to settlement had a high correlation with the risk of forest-fire occurrence. The prediction accuracy of the two algorithms in regard to fire points was higher than that for nonfire points. The overall prediction accuracy and goodness of fit of the RF and BPNN algorithms were similar. The two methods were both suitable for forest-fire occurrence prediction. The high-fire-risk zones were mainly concentrated in the northwestern and central parts of the Heihe area. © 2023 by the authors.",backpropagation neural network; forest-fire driving factor; forest-fire occurrence prediction; random forest,Deforestation; Ecosystems; Forest Fires; Meteorology; Neural Networks; China; Heihe; Heilongjiang; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fire hazards; Fires; Learning systems; Meteorology; Neural networks; Back-propagation neural networks; Driving factors; Fire occurrences; Fire risks; Forest fires; Forest-fire driving factor; Forest-fire occurrence prediction; Random forests; Risk predictions; algorithm; artificial neural network; back propagation; forest fire; prediction; risk assessment; Forecasting,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149048688,Forests,"College of Forestry, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, 150040, China; Heilongjiang Shengshan National Nature Reserve Service Center, Heihe, 164300, China; School of Electrical Engineering, Heilongjiang University, Harbin, 150080, China","Gao C., College of Forestry, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, 150040, China, Heilongjiang Shengshan National Nature Reserve Service Center, Heihe, 164300, China; Lin H., School of Electrical Engineering, Heilongjiang University, Harbin, 150080, China; Hu H., College of Forestry, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, 150040, China",,,,,,,"C.

Fire-driven loss of vegetation cover, for example, directly modifies the surface energy budget as a consequence of changing albedo, surface roughness, and partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes. Carbon dioxide and methane emitted by fires contribute to a positive atmospheric forcing, whereas emissions of carbonaceous aerosols may contribute to surface cooling. Process-based modeling of wildfires in Earth system land models is challenging due to limited understanding of human, climate, and ecosystem controls on fire counts, fire size, and burned area. Integration of mechanistic wildfire models within Earth system models requires careful parameter calibration, which is computationally expensive and subject to equifinality. To explore alternative approaches, we present a deep neural network (DNN) scheme that surrogates the process-based wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) interface. The DNN wildfire model accurately simulates observed burned area with over 90g% higher accuracy with a large reduction in parameterization time compared with the current process-based wildfire model. The surrogate wildfire model successfully captured the observed monthly regional burned area during validation period 2011 to 2015 (coefficient of determination, R2Combining double low line0.93). Since the DNN wildfire model has the same input and output requirements as the E3SM process-based wildfire model, our results demonstrate the applicability of machine learning for high accuracy and efficient large-scale land model development and predictions. © 2022 Qing Zhu et al.",,albedo; carbon dioxide; machine learning; methane; numerical model; wildfire,Copernicus GmbH,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126740936,Geoscientific Model Dev.,"Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States; State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","Zhu Q., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States; Li F., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States, State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Riley W.J., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States; Xu L., Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States; Zhao L., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States; Yuan K., Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Climate Sciences Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States, State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Wu H., State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Gong J., School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Randerson J., Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States",,,,,,,"Q.

This forest provides diverse ecosystem services (mostly non timber forest products)to tribal and non-tribal people throughout the year. The main objective of this study is to demarcate the accurate forest fire susceptibility zones applying three relevant machine learning models i.e., Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN). In this research, more than 300 hundreds historical forest fire events along with 14 forest fire predictors have been considered. DLNN model has the highest efficacy (AUC = 0.925). Features of DLNN are instinctively presumed and optimally tuned for required outcomes. Applied models explicitly examined that the north western and eastern segments of Ayodhya hill are highly susceptible for forest fire due to its physical and social complexity. DLNN model investigates that total 18% areas of Ayodhya hill have come under very high susceptible zone. The forest fire incidents are taken place during March to May because of the effect of high temperature, poor moisture content and existence of high fuel woods. Both the machine and deep learning techniques have been applied first time in this dry deciduous forest belt and models indicated high accuracy and precision which is harmonized with ground reality.

This study utilized a geographic information system (GIS) technique to analyze and understand the factors that regulate the spatial distribution of wildfire incidents and machine learning to predict wildfire susceptibility in Sydney. Wildfire inventory data were constructed by combining the fire perimeter through field surveys and fire occurrence data gathered from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS)-Suomi thermal anomalies product between 2011 and 2020 for the Sydney area. Sixteen wildfire-related factors were acquired to assess the potential of machine learning based on support vector regression (SVR) and various metaheuristic approaches (GWO and PSO) for wildfire susceptibility mapping in Sydney. In addition, the 2019–2020 “Black Summer” fire acted as a validation dataset to assess the predictive capability of the developed model. Furthermore, the information gain ratio (IGR) method showed that driving factors such as land use, forest type, and slope degree have a large impact on wildfire susceptibility in the study area, and the frequency ratio (FR) method represented how the factors influence wildfire occurrence. Model evaluation based on area under the curve (AUC) and root average square error (RMSE) were used, and the outputs showed that the hybrid-based SVR-PSO (AUC = 0.882, RMSE = 0.006) model performed better than the standalone SVR (AUC = 0.837, RMSE = 0.097) and SVR-GWO (AUC = 0.873, RMSE = 0.080) models. Thus, optimizing SVR with metaheuristics improved the accuracy of wildfire susceptibility modeling in the study area. The proposed framework can be an alternative to the modeling approach and can be adapted for any research related to the susceptibility of different disturbances. © 2023 by the authors.",support vector regression; susceptibility map; Sydney; VIIR; wildfire,Fires; Land use; Machine learning; Random forests; Thermography (imaging); Topography; Areas under the curves; Australia; Machine-learning; Study areas; Support vector regressions; Susceptibility maps; Sydney; VIIR; Wildfire; Wildfire susceptibilities; Forestry,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147947326,Remote Sens.,"Division of Science Education, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, 24341, South Korea; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Lamar University, 4400 MLK Blvd, Beaumont, 77710, TX, United States; Department of Smart Regional Innovation, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, 24341, South Korea","Nur A.S., Division of Science Education, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, 24341, South Korea; Kim Y.J., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Lamar University, 4400 MLK Blvd, Beaumont, 77710, TX, United States; Lee J., Division of Science Education, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, 24341, South Korea; Lee C.-W., Division of Science Education, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, 24341, South Korea, Department of Smart Regional Innovation, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, 24341, South Korea",,,,,,,"C.-W.

Effective predictions of wildfire occurrence and burned areas are essential to forest management and firefighting. In this paper we apply various machine learning (ML) methods on a 0.25◦ monthly resolution global dataset of wildfires. We test the prediction accuracies of four different fire occurrence classifiers: random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and a logistic regression. Our best ML model predicts wildfire occurrence with over 90% accuracy, compared to approximately 70% using a logistic regression. We then train ML regression models to predict the size of burned areas and obtain an MAE score of 3.13 km2, compared to 7.48 km2 using a linear regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to be conducted in such resolution on a global dataset. We use the developed models to shed light on the influence of various factors on wildfire occurrence and burned areas. We suggest building upon these results to create ML-based fire weather indices. © 2022 by the authors.

The focus is on developing an intelligent approach for preventing and predicting wildfires that may arise due to changes in atmospheric temperature or other conditions. The proposed solution involves using machine learning and evolutionary deep learning to create a neural model that can interact with the Internet of Things (IoT) and respond in real-time to minimize potential damage. The experiments were carried out in the forests of Jandouba, Tunisia, using Python software. The results demonstrate that this approach offers significant advantages over the most ranked existing Canadian method (FWI) for fire weather index. © 2023, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.",evolutionary deep learning; fire risk prediction; green environment; IOT technology; meteorological signals; self-organizing neural model,,Corvinus University of Budapest,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85179317066,Appl.

Numerous research efforts have leveraged remote sensing and machine learning for classifying land cover and mapping forest vegetation species. In most cases that focused on surface fuel mapping, the spatial scale of interest was smaller than a few hundred square kilometers; thus, many small-scale site-specific models had to be created to cover the landscape at the national scale. The present work aims to develop a large-scale surface fuel identification model using a custom deep learning framework that can ingest multimodal data. Specifically, we use deep learning to extract information from multispectral signatures, high-resolution imagery, and biophysical climate and terrain data in a way that facilitates their end-to-end training on labeled data. A multi-layer neural network is used with spectral and biophysical data, and a convolutional neural network backbone is used to extract the visual features from high-resolution imagery. A Monte Carlo dropout mechanism was also devised to create a stochastic ensemble of models that can capture classification uncertainties while boosting the prediction performance. To train the system as a proof-of-concept, fuel pseudo-labels were created by a random geospatial sampling of existing fuel maps across California. Application results on independent test sets showed promising fuel identification performance with an overall accuracy ranging from 55% to 75%, depending on the level of granularity of the included fuel types. As expected, including the rare—and possibly less consequential—fuel types reduced the accuracy. On the other hand, the addition of high-resolution imagery improved classification performance at all levels. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; deep learning; fuel mapping; machine learning; remote sensing; wildland fire,,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148710554,Fire,"Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States; KBR, USGS, Sioux Falls, 57198, SD, United States; Earth Resources Observation & Science Center, United States Geological Survey, Sioux Falls, 57198, SD, United States; Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, Reno, 89512, NV, United States; Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Laboratory, United States Forest Service, Wenatchee, 98801, WA, United States; Research Applications Laboratory, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, 80305, CO, United States; Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, United States","Alipour M., Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States; La Puma I., KBR, USGS, Sioux Falls, 57198, SD, United States; Picotte J., Earth Resources Observation & Science Center, United States Geological Survey, Sioux Falls, 57198, SD, United States; Shamsaei K., Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Rowell E., Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, Reno, 89512, NV, United States; Watts A., Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Laboratory, United States Forest Service, Wenatchee, 98801, WA, United States; Kosovic B., Research Applications Laboratory, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, 80305, CO, United States; Ebrahimian H., Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Taciroglu E., Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, United States",,,,,,,"E.

Because wildfire behaviour is highly dependent on fuel type and distribution, their accurate estimation is paramount for accurate prediction of the fire propagation dynamics. This paper studies the effect of combining automated hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimisation and recursive feature elimination on the accuracy of three boosting (AdaB, XGB, CatB), two bagging (Random Forest, Extremely Randomised Trees), and three stacking ensemble models with respect to their ability to estimate the vegetation cover type from cartographic data. The models are trained on the University of California Irvine (UCI) cover type dataset using five-fold cross-validation. Feature importance scores are calculated and used in recursive feature elimination analysis to study the sensitivity of model accuracy to the different feature combinations. Our results indicate that the implemented fine-tuning procedure significantly affects the accuracy of all models investigated, with XGB achieving an overall accuracy of 97.1% slightly outperforming the others. © 2023 by the authors.",Bayesian optimisation; ensemble models; forest fire; fuel load; hyperparameter tuning; machine learning,,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148708249,Fire,"Autonomous Vehicles & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AVAILAB), Centre for Future Transport and Cities, Coventry University, Priory St, Coventry, CV1 5FB, United Kingdom","Tavakol Sadrabadi M., Autonomous Vehicles & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AVAILAB), Centre for Future Transport and Cities, Coventry University, Priory St, Coventry, CV1 5FB, United Kingdom; Innocente M.S., Autonomous Vehicles & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AVAILAB), Centre for Future Transport and Cities, Coventry University, Priory St, Coventry, CV1 5FB, United Kingdom",,,,,,,"M.

Existing DL-based techniques, which are mostly based on convolutional networks, have proven to be effective in wildfire detection. However, there is still room for improvement. First, existing methods tend to have some commercial aspects, with limited publicly available data and models. In addition, studies aiming at the detection of wildfires at the incipient stage are rare. Smoke columns at this stage tend to be small, shallow, and often far from view, with low visibility. This makes finding and labeling enough data to train an efficient deep learning model very challenging. Finally, the inherent locality of convolution operators limits their ability to model long-range correlations between objects in an image. Recently, encoder–decoder transformers have emerged as interesting solutions beyond natural language processing to help capture global dependencies via self- and inter-attention mechanisms. We propose Nemo: a set of evolving, free, and open-source datasets, processed in standard COCO format, and wildfire smoke and fine-grained smoke density detectors, for use by the research community. We adapt Facebook’s DEtection TRansformer (DETR) to wildfire detection, which results in a much simpler technique, where the detection does not rely on convolution filters and anchors. Nemo is the first open-source benchmark for wildfire smoke density detection and Transformer-based wildfire smoke detection tailored to the early incipient stage. Two popular object detection algorithms (Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) are used as alternatives and baselines for extensive evaluation. Our results confirm the superior performance of the transformer-based method in wildfire smoke detection across different object sizes. Moreover, we tested our model with 95 video sequences of wildfire starts from the public HPWREN database. Our model detected 97.9% of the fires in the incipient stage and 80% within 5 min from the start. On average, our model detected wildfire smoke within 3.6 min from the start, outperforming the baselines. © 2022 by the authors.",attention mechanism; benchmark; computer vision; deep learning; direct set prediction; encoder–decoder Transformer; incipient stage; smoke; smoke density detection; wildfire,Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decoding; Deep learning; Fires; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Object detection; Object recognition; Signal detection; Signal encoding; Attention mechanisms; Benchmark; Deep learning; Density detections; Direct set prediction; Encoder-decoder; Encoder–decoder transformer; Incipient stage; Smoke density; Smoke density detection; Wildfire; Smoke,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137747862,Remote Sens.,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, 77204, TX, United States","Yazdi A., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Qin H., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Jordan C.B., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Yang L., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, NV, United States; Yan F., Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, 77204, TX, United States",,,,,,,"A.

Due to UAVs' capacity to explore distant locations such as woods, situational awareness for applications, such as search and rescue in wildfires, estimation of endangered flora and fauna, and emergency responses have undergone a paradigm change. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer architecture is suggested for classifying burned piles in dense forests. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the more recent attention-based transformer models have produced cutting-edge outcomes in picture prediction. Convolutions and attention are used in the MLP Mixer architecture in an effort to overcome their drawbacks and improve performance. By including a new module of DePatch in the suggested MLP Mixer model, which separates the input images in a deformable pattern to identify forest fires at an early stage, the shallow learning of CNN layers and fixed-size patch embedding in transformers were eliminated. This suggests that the DePatch-based MLP classification model outperforms transformer approaches in terms of performance, achieving a substantial accuracy of 77.23. Our proposed classification system was evaluated on the pile photos dataset taken during a burning pile of debris in an Arizona pine forest.  © 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",aerial image classification; computer vision; deep learning; multi-layer perceptron Mixer; remote sensing; transformers,Antennas; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Convolution; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fires; Image classification; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Piles; Aerial image classification; Aerial images; Deep learning; Forest fires; Images classification; Mixer modeling; Multi-layer perceptron mixer; Multilayers perceptrons; Remote-sensing; Transformer; Remote sensing,SPIE,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164008396,J.

Experts predict that wildfires will increase in the coming years mainly due to climate change. Early detection and prediction of fire spread can help reduce affected areas and improve firefighting. Numerous systems were developed to detect fire. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles were employed to tackle this problem due to their high flexibility, their low-cost, and their ability to cover wide areas during the day or night. However, they are still limited by challenging problems such as small fire size, background complexity, and image degradation. To deal with the aforementioned limitations, we adapted and optimized Deep Learning methods to detect wildfire at an early stage. A novel deep ensemble learning method, which combines EfficientNet-B5 and DenseNet-201 models, is proposed to identify and classify wildfire using aerial images. In addition, two vision transformers (TransUNet and TransFire) and a deep convolutional model (EfficientSeg) were employed to segment wildfire regions and determine the precise fire regions. The obtained results are promising and show the efficiency of using Deep Learning and vision transformers for wildfire classification and segmentation. The proposed model for wildfire classification obtained an accuracy of 85.12% and outperformed many state-of-the-art works. It proved its ability in classifying wildfire even small fire areas. The best semantic segmentation models achieved an F1-score of 99.9% for TransUNet architecture and 99.82% for TransFire architecture superior to recent published models. More specifically, we demonstrated the ability of these models to extract the finer details of wildfire using aerial images. They can further overcome current model limitations, such as background complexity and small wildfire areas. © 2022 by the authors.

The Fire-YOLO detection model expands the feature extraction network from three dimensions, which enhances feature propagation of fire small targets identification, improves network performance, and reduces model parameters. Furthermore, through the promotion of the feature pyramid, the top-performing prediction box is obtained. Fire-YOLO attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art object detection networks, notably in the detection of small targets of fire and smoke. Overall, the Fire-YOLO detection model can effectively deal with the inspection of small fire targets, as well as fire-like and smoke-like objects. When the input image size is 416 × 416 resolution, the average detection time is 0.04 s per frame, which can provide real-time forest fire detection. Moreover, the algorithm proposed in this paper can also be applied to small target detection under other complicated situations. © 2022 by the authors.

Forest fires are a serious issue that may cause significant loss of life and infrastructure. Forest fires may occur due to human or man-made climate effects. Numerous artificial intelligence-based strategies such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have helped researchers to predict forest fires. However, ML and DL strategies pose some challenges such as large multidimensional data, communication lags, transmission latency, lack of processing power, and privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a recent development in ML that enables the collection and process of multidimensional, large volumes of data efficiently, which has the potential to solve the aforementioned challenges. FL can also help in identifying the trends based on the geographical locations that can help the authorities to respond faster to forest fires. However, FL algorithms send and receive large amounts of weights of the client-side trained models, and also it induces significant communication overhead. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose a unified framework based on FL with a particle swarm-optimization algorithm (PSO) that enables the authorities to respond faster to forest fires. The proposed PSO-enabled FL framework is evaluated by using multidimensional forest fire image data from Kaggle. In comparison to the state-of-the-art federated average model, the proposed model performed better in situations of data imbalance, incurred lower communication costs, and thus proved to be more network efficient. The results of the proposed framework have been validated and 94.47% prediction accuracy has been recorded. These results obtained by the proposed framework can serve as a useful component in the development of early warning systems for forest fires. © 2023 by the authors.

Fire severity data with wide spatial and temporal coverage enhances understanding of fire's impact on vegetation and improves planning to mitigate the risk of destructive wildfires. In this study, we develop a machine learning workflow that converts a spatial database of known fire events into a collection of gridded fire severity maps representing levels of canopy scorch due to wildfires and planned fuel reduction burns (prescribed burns). This workflow uses a dataset of observed fire severity interpreted from post-fire aerial images (3–7 cm spatial resolution; ~11,649 labels from 64 unique fires) to train and test a supervised classifier that predicts fire severity using 13 Landsat-derived spectral indices. For a target fire, the classifier generates a pixel-level prediction of fire severity with classes belonging to one of five ordinal categories ranging from unburnt, three levels of canopy scorch, and canopy consumed by fire. The classifier's accuracy was 84.2% (Kappa score = 0.799) and testing was undertaken across multiple fire types (wildfire / prescribed burn), seasons, forest types and topography. MODIS thermal anomalies and a MODIS-derived burn area product were used to augment the fire severity database with start- and end-of-fire dates to enable accurate delineation of pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery; this method increased model accuracy from 78.0% (Kappa = 0.72). The model was then applied to a regional 16-year (2005 to 2020) history of fire events (n fires = 713, ~1Mha) in the sclerophyll eucalypt forests and woodlands of the Northern Jarrah Forest, Western Australia. On fires with MODIS-adjusted start and end dates, high severity fire (>80% canopy scorch) was predicted more often in wildfires (67.9%, 124900 ha) compared to prescribed burns (14.6%, 110300 ha). However, the total predicted area of high-severity fire was comparable between fire types due to prescribed burns being more frequent on the landscape. We provide the first fire severity model in Western Australia that is broadly calibrated to both prescribed burns and wildfires across multiple conditions. Our model outputs are made freely available and offer opportunities to better understand the interactions between prescribed burns and wildfires, and the effects of fire severity on the environment. © 2022 The Authors",Eucalyptus; Fire severity mapping; Google earth engine; Landsat; Prescribed burn; Wildfire,Australia; Jarrah Forest; Western Australia; Western Australia; Antennas; Classification (of information); Forestry; Managers; Mapping; Radiometers; Statistical tests; Topography; Eucalypti; Fire event; Fire severity; Fire severity mapping; Google earth engine; Google earths; LANDSAT; Post-fire; Prescribed burn; Work-flows; canopy; database; environmental risk; forest management; Landsat; machine learning; mapping; MODIS; Fires,Elsevier Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122616070,Remote Sens.

An efficient and fast response to wildfires is extremely important to reduce the damaging effect on humans and wildlife. This work introduces a methodology for designing an efficient machine learning system to detect wildfires using satellite imagery. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is optimized to reduce the required computational resources. Due to the limitations of images containing fire and seasonal variations, an image augmentation process is used to develop adequate training samples for the change in the forest’s visual features and the seasonal wind direction at the study area during the fire season. The selected CNN model (MobileNet) was trained to identify key features of various satellite images that contained fire or without fire. Then, the trained system is used to classify new satellite imagery and sort them into fire or no fire classes. A cloud-based development studio from Edge Impulse Inc. is used to create a NN model based on the transferred learning algorithm. The effects of four hyperparameters are assessed: input image resolution, depth multiplier, number of neurons in the dense layer, and dropout rate. The computational cost is evaluated based on the simulation of deploying the neural network model on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE device, including Flash usage, peak random access memory (RAM) usage, and network inference time. Results supported that the dropout rate only affects network prediction performance; however, the number of neurons in the dense layer had limited effects on performance and computational cost. Additionally, hyperparameters such as image size and network depth significantly impact the network model performance and the computational cost. According to the developed benchmark network analysis, the network model MobileNetV2, with 160 × 160 pixels image size and 50% depth reduction, shows a good classification accuracy and is about 70% computationally lighter than a full-depth network. Therefore, the proposed methodology can effectively design an ML application that instantly and efficiently analyses imagery from a spacecraft/weather balloon for the detection of wildfires without the need of an earth control centre. © 2023 by the authors.",convolutional neural network; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; wildfire,,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85154608497,Fire,"School of Engineering, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States; Department of Biology, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States; Al-Khwarizmi College of Engineering, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, 10071, Iraq; EECS Department, University of Missouri, Columbia, 65201, MO, United States; Industrial Engineering Technology Department, University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, 39406, MS, United States","James G.L., School of Engineering, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States; Ansaf R.B., School of Engineering, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States, Department of Biology, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States; Al Samahi S.S., Al-Khwarizmi College of Engineering, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, 10071, Iraq, EECS Department, University of Missouri, Columbia, 65201, MO, United States; Parker R.D., School of Engineering, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States, Industrial Engineering Technology Department, University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, 39406, MS, United States; Cutler J.M., School of Engineering, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States; Gachette R.V., School of Engineering, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States; Ansaf B.I., School of Engineering, Colorado State University Pueblo, Pueblo, 81001, CO, United States",,,,,,,"B.I.

However, the increase in its recurrence and intensity, as well as accidental fires can lead to socioeconomic and environmental losses. Due to this dual relationship with fire, near real-time (NRT) fire management is required throughout the region. In this context, we developed, to the best of our knowledge, the first Machine Learning (ML) algorithm based on the GOES-16 ABI sensor able to detect and monitor Active Fires (AF) in NRT in MATOPIBA. To do so, we analyzed the best combination of three ML algorithms and how long it takes to consider a historical time series able to support accurate AF predictions. We used the most accurate combination for the final model (FM) development. The results show that the FM ensures an overall accuracy rate of approximately 80%. The FM potential is remarkable not only for single detections but also for a consecutive sequence of positive predictions. Roughly, the FM achieves an accuracy rate peak after around 20 h of consecutive AF detections, but there is an important trade-off between the accuracy and the time required to assemble more fire indications, which can be decisive for firefighters in real life. © 2022 by the authors.

Despite remarkable advances in fire modeling and weather forecasting, it remains challenging to anticipate catastrophic wildfire events and associated damage. One key missing component is a fire weather prediction system with sufficiently long lead time capable of providing useful regional details. Here, we develop a hybrid prediction model of wildfire danger called CFS with super resolution (CFS-SR) as a proof of concept to fill that void. The CFS-SR model is constructed by integrating the Climate Forecast System version 2 with a deep learning (DL) technique from Single Image Super Resolution, a method widely used in enhancing image resolution. We show that for the 2018–2019 fire season, the CFS-SR model significantly improves accuracy in forecasting fire weather at lead times of up to 7 days with an enhanced spatial resolution up to 4 km. This level of high resolution provides county-level fire weather forecast, making it more practical for allocating resources to mitigate wildfire danger. Our study demonstrates that a proper combination of ensemble climate predictions with DL techniques can boost predictability at finer spatial scales, increasing the utility of fire weather forecasts for practical applications. © 2022 The Authors.

In this view, this paper presents an intelligent wild forest fire detection and alarming system using deep learning (IWFFDA-DL) model. The proposed IWFFDA-DL technique aims to identify forest fires at earlier stages through integrated sensors. The proposed IWFFDA-DL system includes an Integrated sensor system (ISS) combining an array of sensors that acts as the major input source that helps to forecast the fire. Then, the attention based convolution neural network with bidirectional long short term memory (ACNN-BLSTM) model is applied to examine and identify the existence of danger. For hyperparameter tuning of the ACNN-BLSTM model, the bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm is employed and thereby enhances the detection performance. Finally, when the fire is detected, the Global System for Mobiles (GSM) modem transmits messages to the authorities to take required actions. An extensive set of simulations were performed and the results are investigated interms of several aspects. The obtained results highlight the betterment of the IWFFDA-DL technique interms of various measures. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient parameter flexible fire prediction algorithm based on machine learning and reduced order modelling techniques. Using a training dataset generated by physics-based fire simulations, the method forecasts burned area at different time steps with a low computational cost. We then address the bottleneck of efficient parameter estimation by developing a novel inverse approach relying on data assimilation techniques (latent assimilation) in the reduced order space. The forward and the inverse modellings are tested on two recent large wildfire events in California. Satellite observations are used to validate the forward prediction approach and identify the model parameters. By combining these forward and inverse approaches, the system manages to integrate real-time observations for parameter adjustment, leading to more accurate future predictions. © 2022 by the authors.

A prediction model based on environmental condition, such as meteorological and vegetation indexes, is considered a promising tool to control forest fires. The construction of prediction models can be challenging due to (i) the requirement of selection of features most relevant to the prediction task, and (ii) heavily imbalanced data distribution where the number of large-scale forest fires is much less than that of small-scale ones. In this paper, we propose a forest fire prediction method that employs a sparse autoencoder-based deep neural network and a novel data balancing procedure. The method was tested on a forest fire dataset collected from the Montesinho Natural Park of Portugal. Compared to the best prediction results of other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method could predict large-scale forest fires more accurately, and reduces the mean absolute error by 3–19.3 and root mean squared error by 0.95–19.3. The proposed method can better benefit the management of wildland fires in advance and the prevention of serious fire accidents. It is expected that the prediction performance could be further improved if additional information and more data are available. © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; deep neural network; fire prediction; imbalanced data; sparse autoencoder,Averages; Balancing; Control Systems; Data; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Portugal; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Auto encoders; Deep learning; Fire prediction; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Imbalanced data; Large-scale forest fire; Neural network method; Prediction modelling; Sparse autoencoder; artificial neural network; comparative study; environmental conditions; error analysis; fire behavior; fire management; forest fire; forest management; model test; performance assessment; prediction; Deep neural networks,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137148166,Forests,"College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, China; College of Forestry Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China","Lai C., College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, China; Zeng S., College of Forestry Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China; Guo W., College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, China; Liu X., College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, China; Li Y., College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, China; Liao B., College of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, China",,,,,,,"B.

In recent years, the wildfire community has attempted to estimate wildfire occurrence with machine learning models. However, to fully exploit the potential of these models, it is of paramount importance to make their predictions interpretable and intelligible. This study is a first attempt to provide an eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for estimating wildfire occurrence using a Random Forest model with Shapley values for interpretation. Our findings accurately detected regions with a high presence of wildfires (area under the curve 81.3%) and outlined the drivers empowering occurrence, such as the Fire Weather Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Furthermore, our analysis suggests the presence of anomalous hotspots. In contexts where human and natural spheres constantly intermingle and interact, the XAI framework, suitably integrated into decision support systems, could support forest managers to prevent and mitigate future wildfire disasters and develop strategies for effective fire management, response, recovery, and resilience. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Artificial Intelligence; Europe; Fires; Humans; Machine Learning; Wildfires; area under the curve; article; artificial intelligence; decision support system; disaster; forest; human; manager; random forest; Southern Europe; vegetation; weather; wildfire; artificial intelligence; Europe; fire; machine learning,Nature Research,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138918952,Sci.

It is challenging to thoroughly investigate patterns of fire occurrence and fire distribution for predicting wildfire behaviour, and it is especially difficult to distinguish the characteristics of human-caused and climate-driven fires. Here, we identify and assess dense-fire (DF) from the perspective of spatiotemporally integrated processes using a machine-learning method based on a density-based clustering algorithm with noise constraint ratio. DFs represent collections of fires with homogenous behaviour and therefore allow the study of their internal features, which can reveal fixed patterns of fire occurrence and distribution as well as the evolution of fires over time. We estimated and labelled thousands of fire clusters on the Indochina Peninsula between 2010 and 2020, most of which occurred between December and May. For large-scale DFs, the number of fires contained and amount of atmospheric pollutants emitted were accounted for throughout most of the region, and the time, location and scale of their occurrence each year were relatively stable and predictable. Furthermore, the results of a secondary cluster analysis of fire interactions over the past decade showed two extreme fire events, labelled”north” and”south” groups, whose activities significantly impacted the atmospheric environment of the Indochina Peninsula. Additionally, we predicted their start/end dates and daily emissions. The study also found that the recurrence of high-density fires and the correlation between the DF edge and administrative border suggested a positive anthropogenic influence. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to analyze fires in a spatiotemporal Euclidean space by using density-based clustering, with high-density fires as independent subjects to study fire behaviour. The method proposed in this study can provide a reference for wildfire prediction and emission forecasting and fire control work. © 2022",Density-based clustering; FINN; Human-caused fire; Machine learning; MODIS; Wildfire,Indochina; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Forecasting; Density-based Clustering; FINN; Fire distribution; Fire occurrences; Human-caused fire; Indochina Peninsula; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; MODIS; Wildfire; air quality; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; homogeneous medium; machine learning; MODIS; wildfire; Fires,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134811390,Atmos.

In the present work, we propose relying on fire spread simulations to provide a fire danger index representative of the potential for fire spread that includes not only weather but also surrounding vegetation and orography. This is achieved using an artificial neural network emulator called DeepFire, trained based on simulated fire sizes. To determine how relevant this index can be in the assessment of next-day fire danger, the application of DeepFire to fire danger mapping using actual weather forecasts is studied. DeepFire forecasts for 13 fairly large fires that occurred in Corsica are analysed and compared with corresponding forecasts using another fire danger index used in operational conditions, highlighting the differences in terms of precision and the expected results of such predictions. The weather forecasts from which the weather inputs of DeepFire are determined have high spatial resolution and high frequency, which also applies to the fire danger predictions. Additionally, input uncertainty is propagated through DeepFire, resulting in ensembles of emulated fire size. Several approaches are proposed to analyse the results and provide fire danger maps and ratings using this new simulation-based prediction system.  © 2022 CSIRO.

First, the DCNN network model was trained in combination with transfer learning, and multiple pre-trained DCNN models were used to extract features from forest fire images. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) reconstruction technology was used in the appropriate subspace. The constructed 15-layer forest fire risk identification DCNN model named “DCN_Fire” could accurately identify core fire insurance areas. Moreover, the original and enhanced image data sets were used to evaluate the impact of data enhancement on the model’s accuracy. The traditional DCNN model was improved and the recognition speed and accuracy were compared and analyzed with the other three DCNN model algorithms with different architectures. The difficulty of using DCNN to monitor forest fire risk was solved, and the model’s detection accuracy was further improved. The true positive rate was 7.41% and the false positive rate was 4.8%. When verifying the impact of different batch sizes and loss rates on verification accuracy, the loss rate of the DCN_Fire model of 0.5 and the batch size of 50 provided the optimal value for verification accuracy (0.983). The analysis results showed that the improved DCNN model had excellent recognition speed and accuracy and could accurately recognize and classify the risk of a forest fire under natural light conditions, thereby providing a technical reference for preventing and tackling forest fires. © 2022 by the authors.

Much of this population are increasingly adopting social media, and sites like Twitter are increasingly being used as a real-time human-sensor network during natural disasters; detecting, tracking and documenting events. The human-sensor concept is currently largely omitted by wildfire models, representing a potential loss of information. By including Twitter data as a source in our models, we aim to help disaster managers make more informed, socially driven decisions, by detecting and monitoring online social media sentiment over the course of a wildfire event. This paper implements machine learning in a wildfire prediction model, using social media and geophysical data sources with Sentiment Analysis to predict wildfire characteristics with high accuracy. We also use wildfire-specific attributes to predict online social dynamics, as this has been shown to be indicative of localised disaster severity. This may be useful for disaster management teams in identifying areas of immediate danger. We combine geophysical satellite data from the Global Fire Atlas with social data provided by Twitter. We perform data collection and subsequent analysis & visualisation, and compare regional differences in online social sentiment expression. Following this, we compare and contrast different machine learning models for predicting wildfire attributes. We demonstrate social media is a predictor of wildfire activity, and present models which accurately model wildfire attributes. This work develops the concept of the human sensor in the context of wildfires, using users’ Tweets as noisy subjective sentimental accounts of current localised conditions. This work contributes to the development of more socially conscious wildfire models, by incorporating social media data into wildfire prediction and modelling. © 2022, The Author(s).",Machine learning; Satellite data; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter data; Wildfires,,Springer,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134434910,J Comput Soc Sc,"Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; Data Science Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires, Environment and Society, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom","Lever J., Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, Data Science Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires, Environment and Society, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; Arcucci R., Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, Data Science Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires, Environment and Society, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom",,,,,,,"R.

The increase of forest fires caused by the untenable exploitation has motivated the application of concepts such as Industry/Forestry 4.0 and Internet of Forest Things (IoFT) towards improving the performance of current supply chains and assuming an environmental responsibility. This research focuses on the application of IoFT for the prediction of wildfires behavior and proposes a semantic platform for heterogeneous IoFT data aggregation that grants interoperability through semantic technologies. The dataset considered climatic- and vegetation-related data gathered by Brazilian government sensors and satellite information on fires, and Machine Learning predicted the areas affected after a fire event. Both platform and predictions were validated and Random Forest predicted the area with 89% accuracy, showing better performance than Deep Neural Network, with 79%. © 2022",Forestry 4.0; Industry 4.0; IoFT; Machine Learning; Ontology; Platform; Semantic; Wildfires,Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Deforestation; Environmental impact; Fires; Forecasting; Industry 4.0; Supply chains; Behavior prediction; Forest industry; Forestry 4.0; Internet of forest thing; Machine-learning; Ontology's; Performance; Platform; Social and economic development; Wildfire; Semantics,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134396431,Comput Electr Eng,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Asa Norte, DF, Brasilia, 70910-900, Brazil","Rubí J.N.S., Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Asa Norte, DF, Brasilia, 70910-900, Brazil; de Carvalho P.H.P., Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Asa Norte, DF, Brasilia, 70910-900, Brazil; Gondim P.R.L., Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Brasilia, Asa Norte, DF, Brasilia, 70910-900, Brazil",CPEEB,,,,,,"J.N.S.

This is extremely challenging due to the complexities of physical models and geographical features. Running physics-based simulations for large wildfire events in near real-time are computationally expensive, if not infeasible. In this work, we develop and test a novel data-model integration scheme for fire progression forecasting, that combines Reduced-order modelling, recurrent neural networks (Long-Short-Term Memory), data assimilation, and error covariance tuning. The Reduced-order modelling and the machine learning surrogate model ensure the efficiency of the proposed approach while the data assimilation enables the system to adjust the simulation with observations. We applied this algorithm to simulate and forecast three recent large wildfire events in California from 2017 to 2020. The deep-learning-based surrogate model runs around 1000 times faster than the Cellular Automata simulation which is used to generate training data-sets. The daily fire perimeters derived from satellite observation are used as observation data in Latent Assimilation to adjust the fire forecasting in near real-time. An error covariance tuning algorithm is also performed in the reduced space to estimate prior simulation and observation errors. The evolution of the averaged relative root mean square error (R-RMSE) shows that data assimilation and covariance tuning reduce the RMSE by about 50% and considerably improves the forecasting accuracy. As a first attempt at a reduced order wildfire spread forecasting, our exploratory work showed the potential of data-driven machine learning models to speed up fire forecasting for various applications. © 2022",Data assimilation; Deep learning; Fire spread; LSTM; Reduced-order modelling; Wildfire forecasting,Data reduction; Errors; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Data assimilation; Data driven; Deep learning; Fire spread; LSTM; Near-real time; Reduced order modelling; Reduced-order model; Surrogate modeling; Wildfire forecasting; Fires,Academic Press Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131070940,J.

From the perspective of the whole world, forest fires are a natural disaster with a great degree of hazard, and many countries have taken mountain fire prediction as an important measure for fire prevention and control, and have conducted corresponding research. In this study, a forest fire prediction model based on LSTNet is proposed to improve the accuracy of forest fire forecasts. The factors that influence forest fires are obtained through remote sensing satellites and GIS, and their correlation is estimated using Pearson correlation analysis and testing for multicollinearity. To account for the spatial aggregation of forest fires, the data set was constructed using oversampling methods and proportional stratified sampling, and the LSTNet forest fire prediction model was established based on eight influential factors. Finally, the predicted data were incorporated into the model and the predicted risk map of forest fires in Chongli, China was drawn. This paper uses metrics such as RMSE to compare with traditional machine learning methods, and the results show that the LSTNet model proposed in this paper has high accuracy (ACC 0.941). This study illustrates that the model can effectively use spatial background information and the periodicity of forest fire factors, and is a novel method for spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; forest fire; forest fire susceptibility; LSTNet network,Deforestation; Disasters; Fires; Maps; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; China; Correlation methods; Deep learning; Deforestation; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Learning systems; Maps; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Deep learning; Fire prediction models; Forest fire prediction; Forest fire susceptibility; Forest fires; LSTNet network; Modelling and predictions; Prediction-based; Times series; forest fire; GIS; machine learning; natural disaster; remote sensing; satellite data; time series analysis; Forecasting,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156099685,Forests,"College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China","Lin X., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Li Z., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Chen W., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Sun X., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Gao D., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China",,,,,,,"D.

A more reliable susceptibility map helps improve the effectiveness of resource allocation. Thus, further improving the prediction accuracy is always the goal of fire susceptibility modeling. This paper developed a forest fire susceptibility model based on an ensemble learning method, namely light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to produce an accurate fire susceptibility map. In the modeling, a subtropical national forest park in the Jiangsu province of China was used as the case study area. We collected and selected eight variables from the fire occurrence driving factors for modeling based on correlation analysis. These variables are from topographic factors, climatic factors, human activity factors, and vegetation factors. For comparative analysis, another two popular modeling methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were also applied to construct the fire susceptibility models. The results show that temperature was the main driving factor of fire in the area. In the produced fire susceptibility map, the extremely high and high susceptibility areas that were classified by LR, RF, and LightGBM were 5.82%, 18.61%, and 19%, respectively. The F1-score of the LightGBM model is higher than the LR and RF models. The accuracy of the model of LightGBM, RF, and LR is 88.8%, 84.8%, and 82.6%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of them is 0.935, 0.918, and 0.868, respectively. The introduced ensemble learning method shows better ability on performance evaluation metrics. © 2022 by the authors.",fire factors; fire susceptibility map; machine learning; prediction,Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Deforestation; Fireproofing; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Resource allocation; Fire factor; Fire susceptibility map; Forest fires; Gradient boosting; Light gradients; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Random forests; Resources allocation; Susceptibility maps; Fires,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137884657,Remote Sens.,"College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, China","Sun Y., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Zhang F., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Lin H., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Xu S., National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, China",,,,,,,"F.

An accurate understanding of the interactions of meteorological variables and fire behaviour in the landscape is very complex, yet possible. In exploring such understanding, we used 2693 high-confidence active fire points recorded by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor for nine different bushfires that occurred in Victoria between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2009. These fires include the Black Saturday Bushfires of 7 February 2009, one of the worst bushfires in Australian history. For each fire point, 62 different meteorological parameters of bushfire time were extracted from Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) data. These remote sensing and meteorological datasets were fused and further processed in assessing their relative importance using four different tree-based ensemble machine learning models, namely, Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy Forest (FF), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Landsat images were used in deriving the response variable–Relative Difference Normalised Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which was selected by comparing its performance against Difference Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR). Our findings demonstrate that the FF algorithm utilising the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method has the best predictive performance of 96.50%, assessed against 10-fold cross-validation. The result shows that the relative influence of the variables on bushfire severity is in the following order: (1) soil moisture, (2) soil temperature, (3) air pressure, (4) air temperature, (5) vertical wind, and (6) relative humidity. This highlights the importance of soil meteorology in bushfire severity analysis, often excluded in bushfire severity research. Further, this study provides a scientific basis for choosing a subset of meteorological variables for bushfire severity prediction depending on their relative importance. The optimal subset of high-ranked variables is extremely useful in constructing simplified and computationally efficient surrogate models, which can be particularly useful for the rapid assessment of bushfire severity for operational bushfire management and effective mitigation efforts. © 2022 by the authors.

For modeling a geographical information system (GIS) database including 11 influencing factors and 262 fire locations from 2013 to 2018 is used for developing an integrated multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The cat swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm tunes the parameters of the MARS in order to generate accurate susceptibility maps. From the Pearson correlation results, it is observed that land use, temperature, and slope angle have strong correlation with the fire severity. The results demonstrate that the prediction capability of the MARS-CSO model outperforms model tree, reduced error pruning tree and MARS.

Aiming to mitigate these terrible effects, intelligent prediction models focused on early fire detection are becoming common practice. Considering mainly a preventive approach, these models often use tools that indifferently apply statistical or symbolic inference techniques. However, exploring the potential for the hybrid use of both, as is already being done in other research areas, is a significant novelty with direct application to early fire detection. In this line, this work proposes the design, development, and proof of concept of a new intelligent hybrid system that aims to provide support to the decisions of the teams responsible for defining strategies for the prevention, detection, and extinction of forest fires. The system determines three risk levels: a general one called Objective Technical Fire Risk, based on machine learning algorithms, which determines the global danger of a fire in some area of the region under study, and two more specific others which indicate the risk over a limited area of the region. These last two risk levels, expressed in matrix form and called Technical Risk Matrix and Expert Risk Matrix, are calculated through a convolutional neural network and an expert system, respectively. After that, they are combined by means of another expert system to determine the Global Risk Matrix that quantifies the risk of fire in each of the study regions and generates a visual representation of these results through a color map of the region itself. The proof of concept of the system has been carried out on a set of historical data from fires that occurred in the Montesinho Natural Park (Portugal), demonstrating its potential utility as a tool for the prevention and early detection of forest fires. The intelligent hybrid system designed has demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities in such a complex environment as forest fires, which are conditioned by multiple factors. Future improvements associated with data integration and the formalization of knowledge bases will make it possible to obtain a standard tool that could be used and validated in real time in different forest areas. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; design science research; expert systems; intelligent system; machine learning; wildfire,Area; Data; Deforestation; Detection; Development; Expert Systems; Forest Fires; Models; Data integration; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Deforestation; Expert systems; Fire hazards; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Deep learning; Design development; Design-science researches; Early fire; Fire detection; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Proof of concept; Risk matrix; Wildfire; conceptual framework; decision support system; design; detection method; forest fire; machine learning; Fires,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149021142,Forests,"Department of Design in Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, 36208, Spain; Design, Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligent Solutions Research Group (DESAINS), Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur), SERGAS-UVIGO, Vigo, 36213, Spain","Casal-Guisande M., Department of Design in Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, 36208, Spain, Design, Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligent Solutions Research Group (DESAINS), Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur), SERGAS-UVIGO, Vigo, 36213, Spain; Bouza-Rodríguez J.-B., Department of Design in Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, 36208, Spain, Design, Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligent Solutions Research Group (DESAINS), Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur), SERGAS-UVIGO, Vigo, 36213, Spain; Cerqueiro-Pequeño J., Department of Design in Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, 36208, Spain, Design, Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligent Solutions Research Group (DESAINS), Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur), SERGAS-UVIGO, Vigo, 36213, Spain; Comesaña-Campos A., Department of Design in Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, 36208, Spain, Design, Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligent Solutions Research Group (DESAINS), Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur), SERGAS-UVIGO, Vigo, 36213, Spain",,,,,,,"M.

They are typically hard to predict, as their exact location and occurrence are driven by a variety of factors. Identifying a selection of dominant controls can ultimately improve predictions and projections of wildfires in both the current and a future climate. Data-driven models are suitable for identification of dominant factors of complex and partly unknown processes and can both help improve process-based models and work as independent models. In this study, we applied a data-driven machine learning approach to identify dominant hydrometeorological factors determining fire occurrence over Fennoscandia and produced spatiotemporally resolved fire danger probability maps. A random forest learner was applied to predict fire danger probabilities over space and time, using a monthly (2001-2019) satellite-based fire occurrence dataset at a 0.25° spatial grid as the target variable. The final data-driven model slightly outperformed the established Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) used for comparison. Half of the 30 potential predictors included in the study were automatically selected for the model. Shallow volumetric soil water anomaly stood out as the dominant predictor, followed by predictors related to temperature and deep volumetric soil water. Using a local fire occurrence record for Norway as target data in a separate analysis, the test set performance increased considerably. This demonstrates the potential of developing reliable data-driven models for regions with a high-quality fire occurrence record and the limitation of using satellite-based fire occurrence data in regions subject to small fires not identified by satellites. We conclude that data-driven fire danger probability models are promising, both as a tool to identify the dominant predictors and for fire danger probability mapping. The derived relationships between wildfires and the selected predictors can further be used to assess potential changes in fire danger probability under different (future) climate scenarios. © 2023 Sigrid Jørgensen Bakke et al.",,Fennoscandia; Norway; fire management; hydrometeorology; identification method; machine learning; mapping; prediction; satellite data; soil water; wildfire,Copernicus Publications,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147262478,Nat.

Aims: Using machine-learning methods, the aim of this study was to predict the onset of fire propagation (go vs no-go) and type of fire behaviour (surface vs crown fire) in southern Australian semiarid shrublands. Methods: Several machine-learning (ML) approaches were tested, including Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Multilayered Neural Networks, as was the use of augmented datasets developed with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in classification of fire type. Key results: Support Vector Machine was determined as the optimum machine learning classifier based on model overall accuracy against an independent evaluation dataset. This classifier correctly predicted fire spread sustainability and active crown fire propagation in 70 and 79% of the cases, respectively. The application of synthetically generated datasets in the Support Vector Machine model fitting process resulted in an improvement of model accuracy by 20% for the fire sustainability classification and 4% for the crown fire occurrence. Conclusions: The selected ML modelling approach was shown to produce better results than logistic regression models when tested on independent datasets. Implications: Artificial intelligence frameworks have a role in the development of predictive models of fire behaviour.  © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Climate change would alter the link between forest fire and the controlling factors. The objective of the study is to model the forest fire occurrences and quantify the contribution of explanatory geographic, climatic and anthropogenic variables using satellite-derived historical fire data (2003–2019) and machine learning classifiers over the western Himalaya, India. The climatic variables were derived from a regional Earth system model (ROM). Along with the key selected explanatory variables, the conditions of neighbouring (3 × 3) pixels were incorporated to account for the contribution from the surrounding area. Out of the selected classifiers, random forest recorded the most promising performance in k-fold cross-validation (f2-score = 0.95 and f1-score = 0.94) as well as in the final model validation (f2-score = 0.85 and f1-score = 0.84). The elevation and mean neighbour elevation exhibited the highest influence (8.18% and 6.72%, respectively) in forest fire occurrences followed by near-surface temperatures (4.65–5.78%). We predicted the forest fire susceptibility [0, 1] for 2030, 2040 and 2050 using the future climate projections. The predicted map can be useful to plan effective fire management strategies to minimize damage to the forest ecosystem. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Climate; Forest fire; Himalaya; Human activities; Machine learning; Random forest,Himalayas; environmental management; fire management; forest fire; human activity; machine learning; satellite imagery,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145276412,Appl.

Extreme fire conditions, such as drought, have been taking place simultaneously with many of these wildfires. In this study, the relationship was quantified between the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI) and wildfire burn area (BA) in California during the time of 1984-2018, and results indicate that the drought is a significant driver of wildfire BA in California. The methods of wavelet transform coherence, cross wavelet transform, and continuous wavelet transform were used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to analyse and establish the relationship between sc-PDSI and wildfire BA. This study concludes that there was a statistically significant relationship between wildfire BA and sc-PDSI in 6-8-, 5-6-, and 2-3-year bands during the study period, during which sc-PDSI was one of the main drivers for wildfire BA. In addition, machine learning was utilised in conjunction with the Quantile Regression Model (QRM) in order to quantify the relationship between sc-PDSI and wildfire BA in California. The findings provide a promising direction to improved prediction of wildfire BA which is significant in the aid of damage control of wildfires in California, potentially leading to less burned area, less economic damage, and fewer casualties. © 2022 The Author(s).

Pre-fire severity predictions can expedite mitigation efforts because precipitation contributing to these hazards often occurs shortly after wildfires, leaving little time for post-fire planning and management. Aim: The aim of this study was to predict burn severity using pre-fire conditions of individual wildfire events and estimate potential post-fire debris flow to unburned areas. Methods: We used random forests to model dNBR from pre-fire weather, fuels, topography, and remotely sensed data. We validated our model predictions against post-fire observations and potential post-fire debris-flow hazard estimates. Key results: Fuels, pre-fire weather, and topography were important predictors of burn severity, although predictor importance varied between fires. Post-fire debris-flow hazard rankings from predicted burn severity (pre-fire) were similar to hazard assessments based on observed burn severity (post-fire). Conclusion: Predicted burn severity can serve as an input to post-fire debris-flow models before wildfires occur, antecedent to standard post-fire burn severity products. Assessing a larger set of fires under disparate conditions and landscapes will be needed to refine predictive models. Implications: Burn severity models based on pre-fire conditions enable the prediction of fire effects and identification of potential hazards to prioritise response and mitigation. © 2023 CSIRO.

It consists in accurately predicting which areas of a territory are at higher risk of fire occurrence each next day, exploiting solely information obtained up until the previous day. The task’s requirements in spatial granularity and scale of predictions, as well as the extreme imbalance of the data distribution render it a rather demanding and difficult to accurately solve the problem. This is reflected in the current literature, where most existing works handle a simplified or limited version of the problem. Taking into account the above problem specificities, in this paper, we present a machine learning methodology that effectively (sensitivity > 90%, specificity > 65%) and efficiently performs next day fire prediction, in rather high spatial granularity and in the scale of a country. The key points of the proposed approach are summarized in: (a) the utilization of an extended set of fire driving factors (features), including topography-related, meteorology-related and Earth Observation (EO)-related features, as well as historical information of areas’ proneness to fire occurrence; (b) the deployment of a set of state-of-the-art classification algorithms that are properly tuned/optimized on the setting; (c) two alternative cross-validation schemes along with custom validation measures that allow the optimal and sound training of classification models, as well as the selection of different models, in relation to the desired trade-off between sensitivity (ratio of correctly identified fire areas) and specificity (ratio of correctly identified non-fire areas). In parallel, we discuss pitfalls, intuitions, best practices, and directions for further investigation derived from our analysis and experimental evaluation. © 2022 by the authors.

Various machine learning (ML) approaches, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Regression Tree, and Neural Networks (NN), were used to understand their applicability in developing models to predict the rate of spread of grassfires. A dataset from both wildfires and experimental fires comprising 283 records with 7 features was compiled and utilized to develop and evaluate ML-based models. These models produced excellent fits to the model development dataset. Model fit against the evaluation dataset resulted in higher errors, with some of the models that yielded the lowest error against the model development dataset, producing the highest errors against the evaluation dataset. The predictive performance of the best ML-based models against that of operational models was evaluated. The SHAP visualization tool was used to determine the most influential variables in the best-performing models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Bushfire and wildfire; Machine learning; Rate of fire spread; Remote regions; SHAP sensitivity analysis,Backpropagation; Errors; Fires; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Bushfire and wildfire; Bushfires; Fire spread; Learning Based Models; Machine-learning; Model development; Rate of fire spread; Rates of spread; Remote regions; SHAP sensitivity analyse; machine learning; Sensitivity analysis,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136678360,Environ.

However, due to the complex forest environment, the changeable shape of forest fires, and the uncertainty of flame color and texture, forest fire detection becomes very difficult. Traditional image processing methods rely heavily on artificial features and are not generally applicable to different forest fire scenes. In order to solve the problem of inaccurate forest fire recognition caused by the manual extraction of features, some scholars use deep learning technology to adaptively learn and extract forest fire features, but they often use a single target detection model, and their lack of learning and perception makes it difficult for them to accurately identify forest fires in a complex forest fire environment. Therefore, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the manual extraction of features and achieve a higher accuracy of forest fire recognition, this paper proposes an algorithm based on weighted fusion to identify forest fire sources in different scenarios, fuses two independent weakly supervised models Yolov5 and EfficientDet, completes the training and prediction of data sets in parallel, and uses the weighted boxes fusion algorithm (WBF) to process the prediction results to obtain the fusion frame. Finally, the model is evaluated by Microsoft COCO standard. Experimental results show that compared with Yolov5 and EfficientDet, the proposed Y4SED improves the detection performance by 2.5% to 4.5%. The fused algorithm proposed in this paper has better feature extraction ability, can extract more forest fire feature information, and better balances the recognition accuracy and complexity of the model, which provides a reference for forest fire target detection in the real environment. © 2022 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; deep learning; feature extraction; forest fire identification; integrated learning,Accuracy; Deforestation; Detection; Extraction; Forest Fires; Fusion; Paper; Deep learning; Deforestation; Extraction; Fire hazards; Fires; Image processing; Learning systems; Textures; Complex forests; Deep learning; Features extraction; Fire features; Fire recognition; Forest fire identification; Forest fires; Fusion algorithms; Integrated learning; Weighted fusion; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial intelligence; experimental study; forest fire; hazard management; identification method; safety; Feature extraction,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137556007,Forests,"College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China","Qian J., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China; Lin H., College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China",,,,,,,"H.

The time series and spatial dispersion of wildfires have been studied by some scholars. Wildfire samples were acquired in a monthly series for the Montesinho Natural Park historical fire site dataset (January 2000 to December 2003), which can be used to assess the possible effects of geographical and temporal variations on forest fires. Based on the above dataset, dynamic wildfire distribution thresholds were examined using a K-means++ clustering technique for each subgroup, and monthly series data were categorized as flammable or non-flammable depending on the thresholds. A five-fold hierarchical cross-validation strategy was used to train four machine learning models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). Finally, to explore the performance of those we have mentioned, we used accuracy (ACC), F1 score (F1), and the values for the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). The results depicted that the XGBoost model works best under the evaluation of the three metrics (ACC = 0.8132, F1 = 0.7862, and AUC = 0.8052). The model performance is significantly improved when compared to the approach of classifying wildfires by burned area size (ACC = 72.3%), demonstrating that spatiotemporal heterogeneity has a broad influence on wildfire occurrence. The law of a spatiotemporal distribution connection in wildfires could aid in the prediction and management of wildfires and fire disasters. © 2022 by the authors.",machine learning; Portugal; space–time series; wildfire prediction,Portugal; machine learning; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; time series; wildfire,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137724226,Sustainability,"School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150025, China; Chongqing Institute of Engineering, Chongqing, 400056, China","Dong H., School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150025, China; Wu H., Chongqing Institute of Engineering, Chongqing, 400056, China; Sun P., School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150025, China; Ding Y., School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Harbin Normal University, Harbin, 150025, China",,,,,,,"P.

Nowadays, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have provided a novel solution to forest fire occurrence assessment and prediction. In this research, we developed a novel hybrid machine-learning-technique algorithm to improve forest fire prediction based on random forest (RF), gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), and other machine learning models. The dataset we employed was satellite fire point data from 2010 to 2018 from the Chinese Department of Fire Prevention. The efficacy and performance of our methods were examined by validating the model fit and predictive capability. The results showed that the ensemble model LR (logistic regression)-RF-SVM-GBDT outperformed the single RFSVMGBDT model and the LR-RF-GBDT integrated framework, displaying higher accuracy and greater robustness. We believe that our newly developed hybrid machine-learning algorithm has the potential to improve the accuracy of predicting forest fire occurrences, thus enabling more efficient firefighting efforts and saving time and resources. © 2023 by the authors.",China; forest fires; hybrid model; machine learning,Accuracy; China; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Machinery; Trees; China; Adaptive boosting; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Forecasting; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Support vector machines; China; Ensemble models; Fire occurrences; Forest fires; Gradient boosting; Hybrid machine learning; Hybrid model; Machine-learning; Random forests; Support vectors machine; algorithm; forest fire; machine learning; mapping; modeling; satellite data; Decision trees,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156103193,Forests,"Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Forest Steppe Fire Prevention Research Center, China Fire and Rescue Institute, Beijing, 102202, China; Yili Desert and Ecological Science and Technology Center, Elion Resources Group, Beijing, 100026, China; Surveying and 3S Engineering Research Center, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China","Shao Y., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Feng Z., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Cao M., Forest Steppe Fire Prevention Research Center, China Fire and Rescue Institute, Beijing, 102202, China; Wang W., Yili Desert and Ecological Science and Technology Center, Elion Resources Group, Beijing, 100026, China; Sun L., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Yang X., Surveying and 3S Engineering Research Center, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Ma T., Surveying and 3S Engineering Research Center, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Guo Z., Forest Steppe Fire Prevention Research Center, China Fire and Rescue Institute, Beijing, 102202, China; Fahad S., Surveying and 3S Engineering Research Center, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Liu X., Precision Forestry Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Wang Z., Surveying and 3S Engineering Research Center, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China",,,,,,,"Z.

When used as input for wildland fire behavior models, outdated fuel datasets can contribute to misleading forecasts, which have implications for operational firefighting, mitigation, and wildland fire research. Remote sensing and machine learning methods can provide a solution for on-demand fuel estimation. Here, we show a proof of concept using C-band synthetic aperture radar and multispectral imagery, land cover classes, and tree mortality surveys to train a random forest classifier to estimate wildland fire fuel data in the East Troublesome Fire (Colorado) domain. The algorithm classified over 80% of the test dataset correctly, and the resulting wildland fire fuel data was used to simulate the East Troublesome Fire using the coupled atmosphere—wildland fire behavior model, WRF-Fire. The simulation using the modified fuel inputs, where 43% of original fuels are replaced with fuels representing dead trees, improved the burn area forecast by 38%. This study demonstrates the need for up-to-date fuel maps available in real time to provide accurate prediction of wildland fire spread, and outlines the methodology based on high-resolution satellite observations and machine learning that can accomplish this task. © 2022 by the authors.

Hence, reinforcing territorial risk management strategies against wildfires is essential. In this study, we built an early alert system (EAS) with two different Machine Learning (ML) techniques to calculate the meteorological conditions of two Colombian areas: (i) A 3D convolutional neural net capable of learning from satellite data and (ii) a convolutional network to bias-correct the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output. The results were used to quantify the daily Fire Weather Index and were coupled with the outcomes from a land cover analysis conducted through a Naïve-Bayes classifier to estimate the probability of wildfire occurrence. These results, combined with an assessment of global vulnerability in both locations, allow the construction of daily risk maps in both areas. On the other hand, a set of short-term preventive and corrective measures were suggested to public authorities to implement, after an early alert prediction of a possible future wildfire. Finally, Soil Management Practices are proposed to tackle the medium- and long-term causes of wildfire development, with the aim of reducing vulnerability and promoting soil protection. In conclusion, this paper creates an EAS for wildfires, based on novel ML techniques and risk maps. © 2022 by the authors.",bias correction; early alert system; machine learning; Naïve-Bayes classification; risk assessment; soil protection; susceptibility; wildfires,Bayes Theorem; Fires; Soil; Weather; Wildfires; Convolutional neural networks; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Machine learning; Maps; Multilayer neural networks; Risk management; Soils; Weather forecasting; Alert systems; Bias correction; Early alert system; Early alerts; Machine-learning; Naive Bayes classification; Risks assessments; Soil Protection; Susceptibility; Wildfire; Bayes theorem; fire; soil; weather; wildfire; Risk assessment,MDPI,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142763621,Sensors,"Escuela de Ciencias Exactas e Ingeniería, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Earth System Physics, Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, 34151, Italy; Facultad de Estudios Ambientales y Rurales, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Instituto de Estudios y Servicios Ambientales-IDEASA, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Departamento de Ingeniería, Aqualogs SAS, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Edile e Ambientale, Università degli Studi di Padova, Padova, 35122, Italy; Departamento de Medio Ambiente y Sostenibilidad, Universidad Andina Simón Bolivar, Sucre, 703030, Bolivia; Centro de Investigación de Filosofía y Derecho, Universidad Externado de Colombia, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia","Casallas A., Escuela de Ciencias Exactas e Ingeniería, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia, Earth System Physics, Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, 34151, Italy; Jiménez-Saenz C., Facultad de Estudios Ambientales y Rurales, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Torres V., Escuela de Ciencias Exactas e Ingeniería, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Quirama-Aguilar M., Escuela de Ciencias Exactas e Ingeniería, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Lizcano A., Escuela de Ciencias Exactas e Ingeniería, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Lopez-Barrera E.A., Instituto de Estudios y Servicios Ambientales-IDEASA, Universidad Sergio Arboleda, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Ferro C., Departamento de Ingeniería, Aqualogs SAS, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia; Celis N., Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Edile e Ambientale, Università degli Studi di Padova, Padova, 35122, Italy, Departamento de Medio Ambiente y Sostenibilidad, Universidad Andina Simón Bolivar, Sucre, 703030, Bolivia; Arenas R., Centro de Investigación de Filosofía y Derecho, Universidad Externado de Colombia, Bogotá, 11011, Colombia",,"Soil, ",,,,,"A.

Recently, Australia was hit hard by bushfires, the most devastating fires ever faced by the country. The economic damage reported was nearly one billion Australian dollars and an estimated three billion native animals were killed or adversely affected. Given the extent and intensity of this damage, researchers are seeking effective solutions to enable the prediction of fire before it starts to increase the time available for firefighters to protect lives and assets and prepare to mitigate the fires. This motivated us to investigate an approach to address this critical problem. In this article, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based approach that detects anomalies in spatiotemporal measurements of environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, etc.). In the proposed approach, an ML-based model learns the normal spatiotemporal behavior of the environmental data (collected over a period of one year). This is carried out during a one-time training phase. Then, during the detection phase, any spatiotemporal pattern in the real-time data (received from the field sensors) that is different than the normal pattern will be identified by the model as anomaly which indicates a possible bushfire situation. Following this, we propose a supplementary classification model based on Moran's I index to ensure that the detected anomalies are not due to either a sensor failure or a security attack (which are common in Internet of Things). We developed three different ML models for performance evaluation and comparison and used the Forest Fire data set to train them. The results of our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the early detection of fire symptoms. © 2014 IEEE.",Agriculture 4.0; Artificial intelligence; Australian bushfire; Edge Computing; Internet of Things (IoT),Climate change; Deforestation; Internet of things; Risk perception; Turing machines; Application scenario; Classification models; Effective solution; Environmental data; Environmental parameter; Rising temperatures; Spatiotemporal measurement; Spatiotemporal patterns; Fires,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114719427,IEEE Internet Things J.,"Centre Of Cyber Security Research Innovation, School Of Information Technology, Deakin University, Geelong, 3220, VIC, Australia; Department Of Computer Science And Engineering, Thapar University, Patiala, 147004, India; School Of Life And Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Geelong, 3220, VIC, Australia; Distributed Systems Security, Data61, Csiro, Marsfield, 2122, NSW, Australia","Nosouhi M.R., Centre Of Cyber Security Research Innovation, School Of Information Technology, Deakin University, Geelong, 3220, VIC, Australia; Sood K., Centre Of Cyber Security Research Innovation, School Of Information Technology, Deakin University, Geelong, 3220, VIC, Australia; Kumar N., Department Of Computer Science And Engineering, Thapar University, Patiala, 147004, India; Wevill T., School Of Life And Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Geelong, 3220, VIC, Australia; Thapa C., Distributed Systems Security, Data61, Csiro, Marsfield, 2122, NSW, Australia",,,,,,,"K.

In the past two decades, several algorithms utilizing data from Earth observation satellites have been developed to detect fire-affected areas. However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Data fusion; deep learning; remote sensing; wildfire detection,Satellites; Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Damage detection; Deep learning; Fire protection; Fires; Land surface temperature; Remote sensing; Semantics; Earth observation satellites; Fire-affected areas; Functional relationship; Learning from examples; Multisensor satellites; Multispectral instruments; Remote sensing data; Semantic segmentation; algorithm; detection method; fire management; land surface; multispectral image; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; segmentation; Sentinel; wildfire; Satellite imagery,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111669560,IEEE J.

One common representation of the fire progression is through the fire arrival time, which defines the time that the fire arrives at a given location. Estimating the fire arrival time is critical for initializing the fire location within coupled fire-atmosphere models. We present a new method that utilizes machine learning to estimate the fire arrival time from satellite data in the form of burning/not burning/no data rasters. The proposed method, based on a support vector machine (SVM), is tested on the 10 largest California wildfires of the 2020 fire season, and evaluated using independent observed data from airborne infrared (IR) fire perimeters. The SVM method results indicate a good agreement with airborne fire observations in terms of the fire growth and a spatial representation of the fire extent. A 12% burned area absolute percentage error, a 5% total burned area mean percentage error, a 0.21 False Alarm Ratio average, a 0.86 Probability of Detection average, and a 0.82 Sørensen’s coefficient average suggest that this method can be used to monitor wildfires in near-real-time and provide accurate fire arrival times for improving fire modeling even in the absence of IR fire perimeters. © 2021 by the authors.

The mapping of wildfires is particularly important for fire prediction and burned biomass estimation. Therefore, accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is of great importance and has a key role in disaster management. Estimation of burned areas from multispectral datasets is challenging, because of the complexity of the background and the different reflections of wildfires on the targets. To this end, this study presents a novel burned-area mapping framework based on the fusion of multitemporal Sentinel-1 coherence imagery and post-event Sentinel-2 imagery. The proposed framework uses hybrid quadratic morphological (QM) operations and convolution layers for deep feature extraction. The proposed architecture is known as the QMDNN-Net, where the overall framework of QMDNN-Net is based on a deep Siamese network. QMDNN-Net has double streams for extracting deep features from multitemporal coherence data and Sentinel-2 imagery. The streams are similar to each other and have the same number of group-dilated convolution blocks and QM layers. QMDNN-Net is defined based on quadratic dilation and erosion, and then it takes the average of these as output. The results of wildfire mapping with QMDNN-Net are evaluated here with two real-world wildfire datasets based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The results show that QMDNN-Net achieves an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 95.5% and 0.9, respectively, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Burned area; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; morphological operator; sentinel-1; sentinel-2,Convolution; Deep neural networks; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Extraction; Mapping; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Burned areas; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Features extraction; Index; Morphological operator; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Vegetation mapping; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; disaster management; mapping method; optical property; radar; satellite imagery; Sentinel; wildfire; Feature extraction,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130459498,IEEE J.

Identifying wildfire events with high probability of becoming a large wildfire is an important task for supporting initial attack planning. Different methods, including those that are physics-based, statistical, and based on machine learning (ML) are used in wildfire analysis. Among the whole, those based on machine learning are relatively novel. In addition, because the number of wildfires is much greater than the number of large wildfires, the dataset to be used in a ML model is imbalanced, resulting in overfitting or underfitting the results. In this manuscript, we propose to generate synthetic data from variables of interest together with ML models for the prediction of large wildfires. Specifically, five synthetic data generation methods have been evaluated, and their results are analyzed with four ML methods. The results yield an improvement in the prediction power when synthetic data are used, offering a new method to be taken into account in Decision Support Systems (DSS) when managing wildfires. © 2021 by the authors.

Although machine learning (ML) models have yielded significant improvements in wildfire predictions, their limited interpretability has been an obstacle for their use in advancing understanding of wildfires. This study builds an ML model incorporating predictors of local meteorology, land-surface characteristics, and socioeconomic variables to predict monthly burned area at grid cells of 0.25° × 0.25° resolution over the contiguous United States. Besides these predictors, we construct and include predictors representing the large-scale circulation patterns conducive to wildfires, which largely improves the temporal correlations in several regions by 14%–44%. The Shapley additive explanation is introduced to quantify the contributions of the predictors to burned area. Results show a key role of longitude and latitude in delineating fire regimes with different temporal patterns of burned area. The model captures the physical relationship between burned area and vapor pressure deficit, relative humidity (RH), and energy release component (ERC), in agreement with the prior findings. Aggregating the contribution of predictor variables of all the grids by region, analyses show that ERC is the major contributor accounting for 14%–27% to large burned areas in the western US. In contrast, there is no leading factor contributing to large burned areas in the eastern US, although large-scale circulation patterns featuring less active upper-level ridge-trough and low RH two months earlier in winter contribute relatively more to large burned areas in spring in the southeastern US. © 2021.

This approach is partially knowledge-driven and partially data-driven. It exploits active fire points to train the fusion function of factors deemed influential in determining the evidence of burned conditions from reflectance values of multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) data. The fusion function is used to compute a map of seeds (burned pixels) that are adaptively expanded by applying a Region Growing (RG) algorithm to generate the final burned area map. The fusion function is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator, learnt through the application of a machine learning (ML) algorithm from a set of highly reliable fire points. Its semantics are characterized by two measures, the degrees of pessimism/optimism and democracy/monarchy. The former allows the prediction of the results of the fusion as affected by more false positives (commission errors) than false negatives (omission errors) in the case of pessimism, or vice versa; the latter foresees if there are only a few highly influential factors or many low influential ones that determine the result. The prediction on the degree of pessimism/optimism allows the expansion of the seeds to be appropriately tuned by selecting the most suited growing layer for the RG algorithm thus adapting the algorithm to the context. The paper illustrates the application of the automatic method in four study areas in southern Europe to map burned areas for the 2017 fire season. Thematic accuracy at each site was assessed by comparison to reference perimeters to prove the adaptability of the approach to the context; estimated average accuracy metrics are omission error = 0.057, commission error = 0.068, Dice coefficient = 0.94 and relative bias = 0.0046. © 2021 by the author.

In this work, we focus on analyzing and quantifying the influence of landscape topology, understood as the spatial structure and interaction of multiple land-covers in an area, on fire ignition. We propose a deep learning framework, Deep Fire Topology, to estimate and predict wildfire ignition risk. We focus on understanding the impact of these topological attributes and the rationale behind the results to provide interpretable knowledge for territorial planning considering wildfire ignition uncertainty. We demonstrate the high performance and interpretability of the framework in a case study, accurately detecting risky areas by exploiting spatial patterns. This work reveals the strong potential of landscape topology in wildfire occurrence prediction and its implications to develop robust landscape management plans. We discuss potential extensions and applications of the proposed method, available as an open-source software. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Landscape topology; Machine learning; Territorial planning; Wildfire ignition risk; Wildfire management,Application programs; Deep learning; Open source software; Open systems; Risk perception; Deep learning; Ecological impacts; Landscape topology; Machine-learning; Social impact; Spatial patterns; Territorial planning; Wildfire ignition; Wildfire ignition risk; Wildfire management; artificial intelligence; estimation method; land cover; performance assessment; risk assessment; territorial planning; topology; uncertainty analysis; wildfire; Topology,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110195888,Environ.

Globally incidents of forest fire events are on the rise due to human encroachment into the wilderness and climate change. Sikkim with a forest cover of more than 47%, suffers seasonal instances of frequent forest fire during the dry winter months. To address this issue, a GIS-aided and MaxEnt machine learning-based forest fire prediction map has been prepared using a forest fire inventory database and maps of environmental features. The study indicates that amongst the environmental features, climatic conditions and proximity to roads are the major determinants of forest fire. Model validation criteria like ROC curve, correlation coefficient, and Cohen's Kappa show a good predictive ability (AUC = 0.95, COR = 0.81, κ = 0.78). The outcomes of this study in the form of a forest fire prediction map can aid the stakeholders of the forest in taking informed mitigation measures. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",GIS; likelihood map; machine learning; MaxEnt; wildfire,Coverings; Deforestation; Entropy; Forecasts; Forest Fires; GIS; Maps; Climate change; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Maximum entropy methods; Climatic conditions; Correlation coefficient; Environmental features; Forest fire prediction; Inventory database; Mitigation measures; Model validation; Predictive abilities; Fires,Taylor and Francis A.S.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105178602,Scand.

Common empirical modelling methods for FOP include both model-based (statistical modelling) and algorithmic-based (machine learning) approaches. However, it was recently shown that many machine learning models in FOP literature are not suitable for fire management operations because of overprediction if not properly calibrated to output true probabilities. We present methods for properly calibrating statistical and machine learning models for fine-scale, spatially explicit daily FOP followed by a case-study comparison of human-caused FOP modelling in the Lac La Biche region of Alberta, Canada, using data from 1996 to 2016. Calibrated bagged classification trees, random forests, neural networks, logistic regression models and logistic generalised additive models (GAMs) are compared in order to assess the pros and cons of these approaches when properly calibrated. Results suggest that logistic GAMs can have similar performance to machine learning models for FOP. Hence, we advocate that the pros and cons of different modelling approaches should be discussed with fire management practitioners when determining which models to use operationally because statistical methods are commonly viewed as more interpretable than machine learning methods.  © 2021.",artificial intelligence; classification; ensemble; forest fire occurrence prediction; generalised additive model; human-caused; supervised learning,,CSIRO,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116389565,Int.

However, automated surveillance system for early forest fire detection can mitigate such calamities and protect the environment. Therefore, we propose a UAV-based forest fire fighting system with integrated artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for continuous forest surveillance and fire detection. The major contributions of the proposed research are fourfold. Firstly, we explain the detailed working mechanism along with the key steps involved in executing the UAV-based forest fire fighting system. Besides, a robust forest fire detection system requires precise and efficient classification of forest fire imagery against no-fire. Moreover, we have curated a novel dataset (DeepFire) containing diversified real-world forest imagery with and without fire to assist future research in this domain. The DeepFire dataset consists of 1900 colored images with 950 each for fire and no-fire classes. Next, we investigate the performance of various supervised machine learning classifiers for the binary classification problem of detecting forest fire. Furthermore, we propose a VGG19-based transfer learning solution to achieve improved prediction accuracy. We assess and compare the performance of several machine learning approaches such as k-nearest neighbors, random forest, naive Bayes, support vector machine, logistic regression, and the proposed approach for accurately identifying fire and no-fire images in the DeepFire dataset. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in terms of accurate classification, where it achieves the mean accuracy of 95% with 95.7% precision and 94.2% recall.  © 2022 Ali Khan et al.",,Aircraft detection; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire extinguishers; Fire hazards; Fire protection; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Automated surveillance system; Ecological systems; Environmental systems; Fire fighting systems; Forest fire detection; Forest fires; Human lives; Performance; Potential threats; Transfer learning; Fires,Hindawi Limited,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129939930,Mob.

Wildfire susceptibility mapping with machine learning has been proven useful for fire-prevention plans, turning into an indispensable tool in wildfire prevention. However, applications of deep learning models in wildfire susceptibility prediction to date are scarce. This study proposes a new Ensemble model based on two deep learning networks previously presented in literature that achieved remarkable results for forest fire susceptibility and other environmental risks. We compare our model with each of its sub-models, two more deep learning networks, and other machine learning benchmark, namely, XGBoost and SVM. Furthermore, we analyze the effects that different sample patch sizes have on the predictive performance of the algorithms. As case study we selected the fire occurrences in two regions in Chile, from 2013 to 2019. Satellite imagery data for fifteen fire influencing factors in the study area were retrieved to build a dataset to extract the samples to train the models. These factors include elevation, aspect, surface roughness, slope, minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, climatic water deficit, NDVI, land cover type, distance to rivers, distance to roads and distance to urban areas. During training, the best sample patch size was found to be 25 × 25 pixels. As a result, the highest area under the curve (AUC) was 0.953 achieved by the Ensemble model, followed by CNN-1 with AUC = 0.902. The Ensemble model also achieved the best accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and F1 score. Finally, the predicted susceptibility maps suggest that static variables can be considered as predisposing factors, while dynamic variables affect the intensity of the predicted probabilities, with an important role of the anthropogenic variables. These resulting maps may be useful to prioritize wildfire surveillance and monitoring in extensive high risk areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Convolutional neural network; Forestry; Geographical information systems; Satellite imagery; Wildfire susceptibility,Chile; climate change; detection method; evapotranspiration; forest fire; land classification; land cover; machine learning; mapping method; NDVI; patch size; pixel; precipitation (climatology); satellite imagery; surface roughness; wildfire,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113599161,Ecol.

Human intervention into the field of the destruction of nature is another cause of these forest fires. The ability to heal nature is dampened due to the expansion of human territories into forests causing loss of lands for the forests. While human expansion cannot be halted, so we as human must take a responsibility for the consequences and make sure the climatic changes due to such disasters, should be as low as possible. Halting the forest fires is an impossible task, and the best we can do control the fires and the amount of area burnt. This process can be improved by predicting the forest fires and the amount of area that might get burnt due to the predicted fire and take measures against it such that there would be no fire at all or the very least reduce the amount of area burnt during the fire. Machine learning in predictions of forest fires is heavily researched and mostly used in real-time. Though usage of machine learning algorithms has been in use, the accuracy of these models is of the lower levels. The paper introduces using a model which is a hybrid of its predecessors, taking as many postulates from them as possible and leaving the cons behind. The hybrid model which is a combination of support vector machine and random forest regression model is using the data of forest fires in the period of 2011–2020 in India, and able to give more accurate predictions. The proposed RVFR model also results in achieving an accuracy of 94%, which is greater than all of the predecessors and with a variance of 1.0. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Forest fires prediction; Machine learning; Random vector forest regression,India; algorithm; forest fire; integrated approach; machine learning; model; regression analysis; support vector machine,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119345799,Ecol.

Recognition of the occurrence patterns of fires and the identification of fire risk is ben-eficial to mitigate probable fire threats. Machine learning techniques are recognized as well-known approaches to solving non-linearity problems such as forest fire risk. However, assessing such environmental multivariate disasters has always been challenging as modelling may be biased from multiple uncertainty sources such as the quality and quantity of input parameters, training pro-cesses, and a default setup for hyper-parameters. In this study, we propose a spatial framework to quantify the forest fire risk in the Northern Beaches area of Sydney. Thirty-six significant key indi-cators contributing to forest fire risk were selected and spatially mapped from different contexts such as topography, morphology, climate, human-induced, social, and physical perspectives as input to our model. Optimized deep neural networks were developed to maximize the capability of the multilayer perceptron for forest fire susceptibility assessment. The results show high precision of developed model against accuracy assessment metrics of ROC = 95.1%, PRC = 93.8%, and k coef-ficient = 94.3%. The proposed framework follows a stepwise procedure to run multiple scenarios to calculate the probability of forest risk with new input contributing parameters. This model im-proves adaptability and decision-making as it can be adapted to different regions of Australia with a minor localization adoption requirement of the weighting procedure. © 2021 by the authors.

It is applied to a well-studied forest-fire dataset from Portugal Montesinho Natural Park considering 13 input variables. The total burned area distribution of the 517 burn events in that dataset is highly positively skewed. The model is transparent and avoids regressions and hidden layers. This increases its detailed data mining capabilities. It matches the highest burned-area prediction accuracy achieved for this dataset with a wide range of traditional machine learning algorithms. The two-stage prediction process provides informative feature selection that establishes the relative influences of the input variables on burned-area predictions. Optimizing with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as separate objective functions provides complementary information with which to data mine each total burned-area incident. Such insight offers potential agricultural, ecological, environmental and forestry benefits by improving the understanding of the key influences associated with each burn event. Data mining the differential trends of cumulative absolute error and squared error also provides detailed insight with which to determine the suitability of each optimized solution to accurately predict burned-areas events of specific types. Such prediction accuracy and insight leads to confidence in how each prediction is derived. It provides knowledge to make appropriate responses and mitigate specific burn incidents, as they occur. Such informed responses should lead to short-term and long-term multi-faceted benefits by helping to prevent certain types of burn incidents being repeated or spread. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Cumulative absolute error differentials; Data-matched prediction accuracy; Non-regression machine learning; Predicting highly skewed distributions; Wildfire feature selection,Deforestation; Errors; Feature Selection; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Absolute error; Cumulative absolute error differential; Data-matched prediction accuracy; Features selection; Machine-learning; Non-regression machine learning; Predicting highly skewed distribution; Prediction accuracy; Skewed distribution; Wildfire feature selection; Data mining,KeAi Communications Co.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102456950,Artif.

To help land and fire management agencies manage and mitigate wildfire-related risks, we need to develop tools for mapping those risks. Big geodata—in the form of remotely sensed images, ground-based sensor observations, and topographical datasets—can help us characterize the dynamics of wildfire related events. In this study, we design a deep fully convolutional network, called AllConvNet, to produce daily maps of the probability of a wildfire burn over the next 7 days. We applied it to burns in Victoria, Australia for the period of 2006–2017. Fifteen factors that were extracted from six different datasets and resulted into 29 quantitative features, were selected as input to the network. We compared it with three baseline methods: SegNet, multilayer perceptron, and logistic regression. AllConvNet outperforms the other three baseline methods in four of the six quantitative metrics considered. AllConvNet and SegNet provide smoother and more regularized predicted maps, with SegNet providing greater sensitivity in dificriminating less wildfire-prone locations. Input feature statistical importance was measured for all the networks and compared against logistic regression coefficients. Total precipitation, lightning flash density, and land surface temperature occur to be consistently highly weighted by all models while terrain aspect components, wind direction components, certain land cover classes (such as crop field and woodland), and distance from power lines are ranked on the lower end. We conclude that wild-fire burn prediction methods based on deep learning present quantitative and qualitative gains. © 2021",Big geodata; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Input statistical importance; Wildfire burn prediction,Convolution; Deep learning; Fires; Land surface temperature; Regression analysis; fuel; rain; Baseline methods; Big geodata; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Environmental problems; Geo-data; Input statistical importance; Land managements; Logistics regressions; Wildfire burn prediction; AllConvNet; Article; artificial neural network; Australia; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cropland; forest; humidity; intermethod comparison; lightning flash density; logistic regression analysis; multilayer perceptron; precipitation; probability; semantic segmentation; solar radiation; temperature; weather; wildfire; wind speed; Forecasting,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104312573,Saf.

Many different data-driven modelling methods have been used for FOP. Several studies use multiple modelling methods to develop a set of candidate models for the same region, which are then compared against one another to choose a final model. We demonstrate that the methodologies often used for evaluating and comparing FOP models may lead to selecting a model that is ineffective for operational use. With an emphasis on spatially and temporally explicit FOP modelling for daily fire management operations, we outline and discuss several guidelines for evaluating and comparing data-driven FOP models, including choosing a testing dataset, choosing metrics for model evaluation, using temporal and spatial visualisations to assess model performance, recognising the variability in performance metrics, and collaborating with end users to ensure models meet their operational needs. A case study for human-caused FOP in a provincial fire control zone in the Lac La Biche region of Alberta, Canada, using data from 1996 to 2016 demonstrates the importance of following the suggested guidelines. Our findings indicate that many machine learning FOP models in the historical literature are not well suited for fire management operations.  © 2021 Journal Compilation ",area under curve (AUC); Brier score; logarithmic score; mean absolute error (MAE); model selection; precision-recall curve; receiver operating characteristic curve; visual diagnostics; wildfire occurrence,,CSIRO,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100693403,Int.

Forest fires are currently turning a leading cause of forest degradation. The principal objective of this research is to predict forest fire vulnerable zones over Similipal biosphere reserve (SBR; Odisha) using different machine learning (ML) models, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Different resampling methods (CV and bootstrap) have also been applied for optimizing the result and better accuracy. Results show that 10-fold cross validation (CV) technique performed best on SVM model (AUC = 0.83) whereas bootstrap performed best on RF (AUC = 0.80) and MARS model (AUC= 0.84). The main advantage of MARS model is that it only uses input variable and significantly increases the performance of the model. The novelty of this research is application of various ML algorithms through resampling techniques to reduce the biasness and improves the reliability of the models. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Biosphere reserve; multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); random forest (RF); support vector machine (SVM); sustainability,Eastern Ghats; India; algorithm; biosphere; forest fire; machine learning; mountain region; nature reserve; prediction; support vector machine; sustainability,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128768789,Geocarto Int.,"Department of Geography, Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University, Purulia, India; PG Department of Geography, Raja Narendralal Khan Women’s College (Autonomous), Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, India; Department of Geography, Diamond Harbour Women’s University, Sarisha, India; Department of Geography, Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College (University of Calcutta), Kolkata, India","Bera B., Department of Geography, Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University, Purulia, India; Shit P.K., PG Department of Geography, Raja Narendralal Khan Women’s College (Autonomous), Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, India; Sengupta N., Department of Geography, Diamond Harbour Women’s University, Sarisha, India; Saha S., Department of Geography, Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University, Purulia, India; Bhattacharjee S., Department of Geography, Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College (University of Calcutta), Kolkata, India",,,,,,,"S.

The spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of forest burn severity are closely related to its environmental drivers prior to the fire occurrence. The temperate coniferous forest of northern China is an important part of China’s forest resources and has suffered frequent forest fires in recent years. However, the understanding of environmental drivers controlling burn severity in this fire-prone region is still limited. To fill the gap, spatial pattern metrics including pre-fire fuel variables (tree canopy cover (TCC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and live fuel moisture content (LFMC)), topographic variables (elevation, slope, and topographic radiation aspect index (TRASP)), and weather variables (relative humidity, maximum air temperature, cumulative precipitation, and maximum wind speed) were correlated with a remote sensing-derived burn severity index, the composite burn index (CBI). A random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to reveal the relative importance of the environmental drivers mentioned above to burn severity for a fire. The model achieved CBI prediction accuracy with a correlation coefficient (R) equal to 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) equal to 0.16, and fitting line slope equal to 0.64. The results showed that burn severity was mostly influenced by flammable live fuels and LFMC. The elevation was the most important topographic driver, and meteorological variables had no obvious effect on burn severity. Our findings suggest that in addition to conducting strategic fuel reduction management activities, planning the landscapes with fire-resistant plants with higher LFMC when possible (e.g., “Green firebreaks”) is also indispensable for lowering the burn severity caused by wildfires in the temperate coniferous forests of northern China. © 2021 by the authors.

Satellite imaging platforms, particularly those with high revisiting frequencies and fine spatial resolutions, represent the most efficient possible means of monitoring wildfires dynamically. However, the extraction of accurate fire-related information from satellite images remains challenging, and few studies have investigated the use of remote sensing data from satellites with geostationary orbits. The present work addresses these issues by applying over 5,000 images obtained from the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite of a severe Australian wildfire occurring from November 2019 to February 2020 to train and test a fully connected convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying the location and intensity of wildfires. The proposed CNN model obtains a detection accuracy greater than 80%, which greatly exceeds that of other machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and k-means clustering. Moreover, the CNN model can be trained in a relatively short period, even when employing large training datasets, and predictions can be made in just one or two minutes. The proposed model provides insight into the application of deep learning methodologies for wildfire monitoring based on the imagery provided by geostationary satellites, and support for developing similar satellite missions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,Convolutional neural networks; Damage detection; Deep learning; Fires; Geostationary satellites; K-means clustering; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Orbits; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Geostationary orbits; Neural network model; Remote sensing data; Satellite images; Satellite imaging; Satellite platforms; Spatial resolution; Wildfire damages; Wildfire detection; algorithm; data set; detection method; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; support vector machine; wildfire; Neural network models,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139503021,Int.

For short-term, the computational time of traditional simulators is too high to be tractable over large zones like a country or part of a country, especially for fire danger mapping. This issue is tackled by emulating the area of the burned surface returned after simulation of a fire igniting anywhere in Corsica island and spreading freely during one hour, with a wide range of possible environmental input conditions. A deep neural network with a hybrid architecture is used to account for two types of inputs: the spatial fields describing the surrounding landscape and the remaining scalar inputs. After training on a large simulation dataset, the network shows a satisfactory approximation error on a complementary test dataset with a MAPE of 32.8%. The convolutional part is pre-computed and the emulator is defined as the remaining part of the network, saving significant computational time. On a 32-core machine, the emulator has a speed-up factor of several thousands compared to the simulator and the overall relationship between its inputs and output is consistent with the expected physical behavior of fire spread. This reduction in computational time allows the computation of one-hour burned area map for the whole island of Corsica in less than a minute, opening new application in short-term fire danger mapping. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Corsica; Deep neural network; Fire growth prediction; Hybrid architecture; Mixed inputs; Numerical simulation,Computer Simulation; Deep Learning; Forecasting; France; Geographic Mapping; Time Factors; Wildfires; Fires; Large dataset; Mapping; Network architecture; Numerical models; Statistical tests; Computational time; Corsica; Fire danger; Fire growth prediction; Fire spread; Hybrid architectures; Mixed input; Neural-networks; Short term; Wildland fire; analytical error; Article; data processing; deep learning; deep neural network; geographic mapping; prediction; priority journal; simulation; two-dimensional imaging; wildfire; computer simulation; forecasting; France; procedures; time factor; Deep neural networks,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105553630,Neural Netw.,"Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique (INRIA), 2 rue Simone Iff, Paris, France; Sorbonne Université, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, France; Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), Sciences pour l'Environnement – Unité Mixte de Recherche 6134, Università di Corsica, Campus Grossetti, Corte, France","Allaire F., Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique (INRIA), 2 rue Simone Iff, Paris, France, Sorbonne Université, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, France; Mallet V., Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique (INRIA), 2 rue Simone Iff, Paris, France, Sorbonne Université, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, France; Filippi J.-B., Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), Sciences pour l'Environnement – Unité Mixte de Recherche 6134, Università di Corsica, Campus Grossetti, Corte, France",NNETE,,,,,,"F.

However, some limitations remain in acquiring insights from data, such as the risk of overfitting caused by insufficient datasets. Moreover, most previous studies have only focused on detecting fires or smoke, whereas detecting persons and other objects of interest is equally crucial for wildfire response strategies. Therefore, this study developed a multilabel classification (MLC) model, which applies transfer learning and data augmentation and outputs multiple pieces of information on the same object or image. VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121 were used as pretrained models for transfer learning. The models were trained using the dataset constructed in this study and were compared based on various performance metrics. Moreover, the use of control variable methods revealed that transfer learning and data augmentation can perform better when used in the proposed MLC model. The resulting visualization is a heatmap processed from gradient-weighted class activation mapping that shows the reliability of predictions and the posi-tion of each class. The MLC model can address the limitations of existing forest fire identification algorithms, which mostly focuses on binary classification. This study can guide future research on implementing deep learning-based field image analysis and decision support systems in wildfire response work. © 2021 by the authors.

In 2018, wildfires cost nearly 800 million dollars in economic loss and claimed more than 100 lives in California. Over 1.6 million acres of land has burned and caused large sums of environmental damage. Although, recently, researchers have introduced machine learning models and algorithms in predicting the wildfire risks, these results focused on special perspectives and were restricted to a limited number of data parameters. In this paper, we have proposed two data-driven machine learning approaches based on random forest models to predict the wildfire risk at areas near Monticello and Winters, California. This study demonstrated how the models were developed and applied with comprehensive data parameters such as powerlines, terrain, and vegetation in different perspectives that improved the spatial and temporal accuracy in predicting the risk of wildfire including fire ignition. The combined model uses the spatial and the temporal parameters as a single combined dataset to train and predict the fire risk, whereas the ensemble model was fed separate parameters that were later stacked to work as a single model. Our experiment shows that the combined model produced better results compared to the ensemble of random forest models on separate spatial data in terms of accuracy. The models were validated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, learning curves, and evaluation metrics such as: accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification report. The study results showed and achieved cutting-edge accuracy of 92% in predicting the wildfire risks, including ignition by utilizing the regional spatial and temporal data along with standard data parameters in Northern California. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there exists at present no scalable solution to acquire consistent information about active forest fires that is both spatially and temporally explicit. To overcome this limitation, we propose a statistical downscaling scheme based on deep learning that leverages multi-source Remote Sensing (RS) data. Our system relies on a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to downscale Geostationary (GEO) satellite multispectral imagery and continuously monitor active fire progression with a spatial resolution similar to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) sensors. In order to achieve this, the model trains on LEO RS products, land use information, vegetation properties, and terrain data. The practical implementation has been optimized to use cloud compute clusters, software containers and multi-step parallel pipelines in order to facilitate real time operational deployment. The performance of the model was validated in five wildfires selected from among the most destructive that occurred in California in 2017 and 2018. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in monitoring fire progression with high spatiotemporal resolution, which can be instrumental for decision support during the first hours of wildfires that may quickly become large and dangerous. Additionally, the proposed methodology can be leveraged to collect detailed quantitative data about real-scale wildfire behaviour, thus supporting the development and validation of fire spread models. © 2021 by the authors.

The Mediterranean region is traditionally the most at risk in Europe, but continental countries like Serbia have experienced significant economic and ecological losses due to forest fires. To prevent damage to forests and infrastructure, alongside other societal losses, it is necessary to create an effective protection system against fire, which minimizes the harmful effects. Forest fire probability mapping, as one of the basic tools in risk management, allows the allocation of resources for fire suppression, within a fire season, from zones with a lower risk to those under higher threat. Logistic regression (LR) has been used as a standard procedure in forest fire probability mapping, but in the last decade, machine learning methods such as fandom forest (RF) have become more frequent. The main goals in this study were to (i) determine the main explanatory variables for forest fire occurrence for both models, LR and RF, and (ii) map the probability of forest fire occurrence in Eastern Serbia based on LR and RF. The most important variable was drought code, followed by different anthropogenic features depending on the type of the model. The RF models demonstrated better overall predictive ability than LR models. The map produced may increase firefighting efficiency due to the early detection of forest fire and enable resources to be allocated in the eastern part of Serbia, which covers more than one-third of the country’s area. © 2020 by the authors.

The development of computational ensemble models for improving the predictive accuracy of forest fire susceptibilities could save time and cost in firefighting efforts. Here, we combined a locally weighted learning (LWL) algorithm with the Cascade Generalization (CG), Bagging, Decorate, and Dagging ensemble learning techniques for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility in the Pu Mat National Park, Nghe An Province, Vietnam. A geospatial database that contained records from 56 historical fires and nine explanatory variables was employed to train the standalone LWL model and its derived ensemble models. The models were validated for their goodness-of-fit and predictive capability using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and several other statistical performance criteria. The CG-LWL and Bagging-LWL models with AUC = 0.993 showed the highest training performance, whereas the Dagging-LWL ensemble model with AUC = 0.983 performed better than Decorate-LWL (AUC = 0.976), CG-LWL and Bagging-LWL (AUC = 0.972), and LWL (AUC = 0.965) for predicting the spatial pattern of fire susceptibilities across the study area. Our study promotes the application of ensemble models in forest fire prediction and enhances the researchers' understanding of the processes of model building. Although these four ensemble models were originally developed for the estimation of forest fire susceptibility, the models are sufficiently general to be used for predicting other types of natural hazards, such as landslides, floods, and dust storms, by considering local geo-environmental factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bagging; Cascade Generalization; Dagging; Decorate; Ensemble modeling; Machine learning,Nghe An; Viet Nam; accuracy assessment; algorithm; ecological modeling; ensemble forecasting; forest ecosystem; forest fire; mapping method; prediction; spatial analysis,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104055760,Ecol.

In southern California (USA), the Rowe, Countryman, and Storey (RCS) 1949 methodology is an empirical method that is used to rapidly estimate post-fire peak streamflow. We re-evaluated the accuracy of RCS for 33 watersheds under current conditions. Pre-fire peak streamflow prediction performance was low, where the average R2 was 0.29 and average RMSE was 1.10 cms/km2 for the 2- and 10-year recurrence interval events, respectively. Post-fire, RCS performance was also low, with an average R2 of 0.26 and RMSE of 15.77 cms/km2 for the 2- and 10-year events. We demonstrated that RCS overgeneralizes watershed processes and does not adequately represent the spatial and temporal variability in systems affected by wildfire and extreme weather events and often underpredicted peak streamflow without sediment bulking factors. A novel application of machine learning was used to identify critical watershed characteristics including local physiography, land cover, geology, slope, aspect, rainfall intensity, and soil burn severity, resulting in two random forest models with 45 and five parameters (RF-45 and RF-5, respectively) to predict post-fire peak streamflow. RF-45 and RF-5 performed better than the RCS method; however, they demonstrated the importance and reliance on data availability. The important parameters identified by the machine learning techniques were used to create a three-dimensional polynomial function to calculate post-fire peak streamflow in small catchments in southern California during the first year after fire (R2 = 0.82; RMSE = 6.59 cms/km2) which can be used as an interim tool by post-fire risk assessment teams. We conclude that a significant increase in data collection of high temporal and spatial resolution rainfall intensity, streamflow, and sediment loading in channels will help to guide future model development to quantify post-fire flood risk. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","flooding; post-fire peak streamflow; random forest; Rowe, Countryman, and Storey; wildfire",California; United States; Catchments; Decision trees; Floods; Forecasting; Machine learning; Rain; Risk assessment; Stream flow; Watersheds; Extreme weather events; Machine learning techniques; Polynomial functions; Recurrence intervals; Spatial and temporal variability; Streamflow prediction; Temporal and spatial; Watershed characteristics; analytical method; debris flow; flooding; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; watershed; wildfire; Fires,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096765908,Hydrol.

However, recent episodes of wildfires of 2019 in Australia and Brazil are sad reminders of their heavy ecological and economical costs. Understanding the role of environmental factors in the likelihood of wildfires in a spatial context would be instrumental in mitigating it. In this study, 15 environmental features encompassing meteorological, topographical, ecological, in situ and anthropogenic factors have been considered for preparing the wildfire likelihood map of Sikkim Himalaya. A comparative study on the efficiency of machine learning methods like Generalized Linear Model, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) has been performed to identify the best performing algorithm in wildfire prediction. The study indicates that all the machine learning methods are good at predicting wildfires. However, RF has outperformed, followed by GBM in the prediction. Also, environmental features like average temperature, average wind speed, proximity to roadways and tree cover percentage are the most important determinants of wildfires in Sikkim Himalaya. This study can be considered as a decision support tool for preparedness, efficient resource allocation and sensitization of people towards mitigation of wildfires in Sikkim. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Algorithm; Forest fire; GIS; Prediction map; Statistical learning,Australia; Brazil; algorithm; digital mapping; forest fire; machine learning; maximum likelihood analysis; MODIS; satellite data; satellite imagery; wildfire,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112411529,Nat.

The development of accurate strategies to prevent potential impacts and minimize the occurrence of disastrous events as much as possible requires modeling and forecasting severe conditions. In this study, we developed five new hybrid machine learning algorithms namely, Frequency Ratio-Multilayer Perceptron (FR-MLP), Frequency Ratio-Logistic Regression (FR-LR), Frequency Ratio-Classification and Regression Tree (FR-CART), Frequency Ratio-Support Vector Machine (FR-SVM), and Frequency Ratio-Random Forest (FR-RF), for mapping forest fire susceptibility in the north of Morocco. To this end, a total of 510 points of historic forest fires as the forest fire inventory map and 10 independent causal factors including elevation, slope, aspect, distance to roads, distance to residential areas, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature, and wind speed were used. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) was computed to assess the effectiveness of the models. The results of conducting proposed models indicated that RF-FR achieved the highest performance (AUC = 0.989), followed by SVM-FR (AUC = 0.959), MLP-FR (AUC = 0.858), CART-FR (AUC = 0.847), LR-FR (AUC = 0.809) in the forecasting of the forest fire. The outcome of this research as a prediction map of forest fire risk areas can provide crucial support for the management of Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Moreover, the results demonstrate that these novel developed hybrid models can increase the accuracy and performance of forest fire susceptibility studies and the approach can be applied to other areas. © 2021 The Author(s)",Forest fire; Hybrid machine learning algorithm; Mediterranean area; Remote sensing,Morocco; Decision trees; Disaster prevention; Ecosystems; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Land use; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Mapping; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Wind; Fire mapping; Forest fire disasters; Forest fires; Frequency ratios; Hybrid machine learning algorithm; Machine learning algorithms; Mediterranean areas; Performance; Remote machines; Remote-sensing; accuracy assessment; algorithm; ecological modeling; forest ecosystem; forest fire; machine learning; mapping method; Mediterranean environment; NDVI; remote sensing; support vector machine; Deforestation,Elsevier B.V.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108686922,Ecol.

The major threat raising in forest areas is a fire, in which the forest fire scenario is the most important cause to destroy many trees and animals within a few hours. The technologies such as deep learning, IoT and smart sensors provide a lead to design a smart forest fire prediction scheme to support nature to manage the ecosystem in the proper way. This paper is intended to design a forest fire prediction mechanism. Learning-based forest fire prediction scheme (LBFFPS) based on deep learning has been proposed for the prediction in the timely manner. This approach identifies the forest fire based on the sensor unit associated with the system with respect to the learning logics. A digital camera with 1020-megapixel has adapted for the surveillance. The sensor unit consists of two different and powerful sensors such as smoke identification sensor and the temperature and humidity monitoring sensor. Based on these two sensors the surrounding smoke presence, temperature and the humidity level have been identified and reported using the NodeMCU controller. In this application, internet of things (IoT) is associated, to provide a wireless communication alert ability. It collects and maintain the information regarding the forest provided by the sensor unit to the remote cloud server environment. The NodeMCU microcontroller has an inbuilt WiFi to acquire the internet signals and provides a constant bridge between the sensor unit and the server end for remote data maintenance. The proposed logic is helpful to identify the fire signals and inform the respective person to take appropriate action to prevent the forest fire. © 2022 J Ananthi et al.",Deep learning; Forest fire prediction; Internet of things (IoT); LBFFPS,,Accent Social and Welfare Society,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128373052,Int.

Such occurrences are the cause of both short-and long-term damages. Thus, to limit their impact and plan the restoration process, a rapid intervention by authorities is needed, which can be enhanced by the use of satellite imagery and automatic burned area delineation methodologies, accelerating the response and the decision-making processes. In this context, we analyze the burned area severity estimation problem by exploiting a state-of-the-art deep learning framework. Experimental results compare different model architectures and loss functions on a very large real-world Sentinel2 satellite dataset. Furthermore, a novel multi-channel attention-based analysis is presented to uncover the prediction behaviour and provide model interpretability. A perturbation mechanism is applied to an attention-based DS-UNet to evaluate the contribution of different domain-driven groups of channels to the severity estimation problem. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to propose novel solutions to their two primary limitations, including the lack of robust fuel classification method and the low spatial resolution of wildfire growth accuracy assessment while ensuring wide applicability using open data satellite missions and software. The first objective was to create a robust two-step fuel model classification method consisted of the supervised machine learning classification of generalized land cover classes in the 1st level and their individual unsupervised classification to vegetation subtypes in the 2nd level. The second objective was creating a wildfire prediction accuracy assessment method using MODIS 250 m images, which overcome the limitations of low spatial resolution while preserving sub-daily temporal resolution. The wildfire on the Korčula island in Croatia was analyzed in the study, being specific for its long duration from 18 to 24 July 2015. The wildfire ignition occurred in the isolated area, which prolonged the response time from emergency agencies. Random Forest (RF) with input Landsat 8 spectral bands and indices resulted in the highest classification accuracy in the 1st classification level with an overall agreement of 83.6%. The vegetation subclasses from the 2nd classification level were matched to the 13 standard fuel models for the input in FARSITE software. The predicted wildfire evaluation showed the highest mean accuracy of 0.906 for the first two days, which decreased to 0.722 in the latter stages of the active wildfire caused by overprediction. The proposed two-step fuel model classification presented a cost-efficient solution to the fuel map creation in any part of the world, with a disadvantage of no in-situ ground truth identification and accuracy assessment for 2nd classification level. The evaluation of wildfire growth prediction with 250 m images enabled high spatial and temporal resolution of the assessment, while its limitations of wildfire overprediction and the negative effects of wildfire smoke in MODIS images should be addressed in future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",FARSITE; Forest fire; Fuel model; Landsat 8; Machine learning; MODIS,Croatia; Smoke; Wildfires; Croatia; Climate change; Deforestation; Fires; Forecasting; Image resolution; Learning systems; Open Data; Radiometers; Smoke; Supervised learning; Vegetation; Accuracy assessment; Classification methods; FARSITE; Forest fires; Fuel model; LANDSAT; Landsat 8; Machine-learning; MODIS; Spatial resolution; accuracy assessment; global climate; land cover; Landsat; machine learning; MODIS; satellite data; unsupervised classification; wildfire; article; Croatia; forest fire; land use; prediction; random forest; reaction time; satellite imagery; smoke; software; supervised machine learning; wildfire; wildfire; Landsat,Academic Press,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121736364,J.
