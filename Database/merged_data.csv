To anticipate and discover forest fires, several technologies and techniques were put forth. To forecast the likelihood of forest fires and evaluate the risk of forest fire-induced damage, artificial intelligence techniques are a crucial enabling technology. In current times, there has been a lot of interest in machine learning techniques. The machine learning methods that are used to identify and forecast forest fires are reviewed in this article. Selecting the best forecasting model is a constant gamble because each ML algorithm has advantages and disadvantages. Our main goal is to discover the research gaps and recent studies that use machine learning techniques to study forest fires.

Yazici K.; Taskin A.,"Yazici, Kübra (57219387280); Taskin, Alev (23396453200)",A Comparative Bayesian Optimization-based Machine Learning And Artificial Neural Networks Approach For Burned Area Prediction In Forest Fires: An Application In Turkey,2023,Natural Hazards,"This study presents a prediction methodology to assist in designing an effective resource planning for wildfire fighting. The presented methodology uses artificial neural networks, bagging and boosting in ensemble learning algorithms, and traditional machine learning algorithms decision tree regression, Gaussian process regression and support vector regression to determine the size of the area to be burned in a forest fire that will start. The Bayesian optimization algorithm, which is used in the learning process of the methods, provides the optimum hyperparameter values of the methods to obtain the minimum error value. The methodology, which is first used to predict the size of the fires that occurred in different regions of Turkey between 2015 and 2019, yielded successful results. Second, it is applied to the Montesinho Natural Park forest fire dataset in Portugal to validate its robustness in different geographical regions. Finally, the results are compared with different studies in the literature. Compared with the literature, it is seen that the presented methodology has high accuracy and high speed in the prediction of the burned area. The results of the study are significant as the proposed methodology provides valuable information to the authorized units regarding resource planning during the forest fire response phase. Furthermore, the findings show that the presented methodology is reliable and can be used as an additional tool to predict the burned area for different countries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Artificial neural networks; Bayesian optimization; Machine learning; Prediction; Wildfire,Portugal; Turkey; algorithm; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; comparative study; forest fire; hazard management; prediction
"Janiec, P; Gadal, S","Janiec, Piotr; Gadal, Sebastien",A Comparison Of Two Machine Learning Classification Methods For Remote Sensing Predictive Modeling Of The Forest Fire In The North-eastern Siberia,2020,REMOTE SENSING,"The problem of forest fires in Yakutia is not as well studied as in other countries. Two methods of machine learning classifications were implemented to determine the risk of fire: MaxENT and random forest. The initial materials to define fire risk factors were satellite images and their products of various spatial and spectral resolution (Landsat TM, Modis TERRA, GMTED2010, VIIRS), vector data (OSM), and bioclimatic variables (WORLDCLIM). The results of the research showed a strong human influence on the risk in this region, despite the low population density. Anthropogenic factors showed a high correlation with the occurrence of wildfires, more than climatic or topographical factors. Other factors affect the risk of fires at the macroscale and microscale, which should be considered when modeling. The random forest method showed better results in the macroscale, however, the maximum entropy model was better in the microscale. The exclusion of variables that do not show a high correlation, does not always improve the modeling results. The random forest presence prediction model is a more accurate method and significantly reduces the risk territory. The reverse is the method of maximum entropy, which is not as accurate and classifies very large areas as endangered. Further study of this topic requires a clearer and conceptually developed approach to the application of remote sensing data. Therefore, this work makes sense to lay the foundations of the future, which is a completely automated fire risk assessment application in the Republic of Sakha. The results can be used in fire prophylactics and planning fire prevention. In the future, to determine the risk well, it is necessary to combine the obtained maps with the seasonal risk determined using indices (for example, the Nesterov index 1949) and the periodic dynamics of forest fires, which Isaev and Utkin studied in 1963. Such actions can help to build an application, with which it will be possible to determine the risk of wildfire and the spread of fire during extreme events.",wildfires; MaxENT; random forest; risk modeling; GIS; multi-scale analysis; Yakutia; Artic; Siberia,SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PROBABILITY; VEGETATION; LANDSCAPE; WILDFIRES; ENTROPY; YAKUTIA

Therefore, the development of a new risk model to assess the risk of forest fires is the main purpose at present. Zhenjiang City, China was set as the study area, and the original data around 2022 were applied to assess the forest fire risk. This study applied multi-criteria decision analysis technology and machine learning to construct a comprehensive assessment model. In addition, six methods were applied to evaluate the severity and display fire maps. Finally, four model parameters and receiver operating characteristic curves were applied to verify the accuracy of the model. The results show that the random forest has the best prediction effect. The accuracy and the area under the curve were 0.8086 and 0.9312, respectively. Moreover, land use, precipitation, and population density are the three most important factors.

When used as input for wildland fire behavior models, outdated fuel datasets can contribute to misleading forecasts, which have implications for operational firefighting, mitigation, and wildland fire research. Remote sensing and machine learning methods can provide a solution for on-demand fuel estimation. Here, we show a proof of concept using C-band synthetic aperture radar and multispectral imagery, land cover classes, and tree mortality surveys to train a random forest classifier to estimate wildland fire fuel data in the East Troublesome Fire (Colorado) domain. The algorithm classified over 80% of the test dataset correctly, and the resulting wildland fire fuel data was used to simulate the East Troublesome Fire using the coupled atmosphere—wildland fire behavior model, WRF-Fire. The simulation using the modified fuel inputs, where 43% of original fuels are replaced with fuels representing dead trees, improved the burn area forecast by 38%. This study demonstrates the need for up-to-date fuel maps available in real time to provide accurate prediction of wildland fire spread, and outlines the methodology based on high-resolution satellite observations and machine learning that can accomplish this task. © 2022 by the authors.

They are typically hard to predict, as their exact location and occurrence are driven by a variety of factors. Identifying a selection of dominant controls can ultimately improve predictions and projections of wildfires in both the current and a future climate. Data-driven models are suitable for identification of dominant factors of complex and partly unknown processes and can both help improve process-based models and work as independent models. In this study, we applied a data-driven machine learning approach to identify dominant hydrometeorological factors determining fire occurrence over Fennoscandia and produced spatiotemporally resolved fire danger probability maps. A random forest learner was applied to predict fire danger probabilities over space and time, using a monthly (2001-2019) satellite-based fire occurrence dataset at a 0.25° spatial grid as the target variable. The final data-driven model slightly outperformed the established Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) used for comparison. Half of the 30 potential predictors included in the study were automatically selected for the model. Shallow volumetric soil water anomaly stood out as the dominant predictor, followed by predictors related to temperature and deep volumetric soil water. Using a local fire occurrence record for Norway as target data in a separate analysis, the test set performance increased considerably. This demonstrates the potential of developing reliable data-driven models for regions with a high-quality fire occurrence record and the limitation of using satellite-based fire occurrence data in regions subject to small fires not identified by satellites. We conclude that data-driven fire danger probability models are promising, both as a tool to identify the dominant predictors and for fire danger probability mapping. The derived relationships between wildfires and the selected predictors can further be used to assess potential changes in fire danger probability under different (future) climate scenarios. © 2023 Sigrid Jørgensen Bakke et al.",,Fennoscandia; Norway; fire management; hydrometeorology; identification method; machine learning; mapping; prediction; satellite data; soil water; wildfire

However, there exists at present no scalable solution to acquire consistent information about active forest fires that is both spatially and temporally explicit. To overcome this limitation, we propose a statistical downscaling scheme based on deep learning that leverages multi-source Remote Sensing (RS) data. Our system relies on a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to downscale Geostationary (GEO) satellite multispectral imagery and continuously monitor active fire progression with a spatial resolution similar to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) sensors. In order to achieve this, the model trains on LEO RS products, land use information, vegetation properties, and terrain data. The practical implementation has been optimized to use cloud compute clusters, software containers and multi-step parallel pipelines in order to facilitate real time operational deployment. The performance of the model was validated in five wildfires selected from among the most destructive that occurred in California in 2017 and 2018. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in monitoring fire progression with high spatiotemporal resolution, which can be instrumental for decision support during the first hours of wildfires that may quickly become large and dangerous. Additionally, the proposed methodology can be leveraged to collect detailed quantitative data about real-scale wildfire behaviour, thus supporting the development and validation of fire spread models. © 2021 by the authors.

Wildfire susceptibility mapping with machine learning has been proven useful for fire-prevention plans, turning into an indispensable tool in wildfire prevention. However, applications of deep learning models in wildfire susceptibility prediction to date are scarce. This study proposes a new Ensemble model based on two deep learning networks previously presented in literature that achieved remarkable results for forest fire susceptibility and other environmental risks. We compare our model with each of its sub-models, two more deep learning networks, and other machine learning benchmark, namely, XGBoost and SVM. Furthermore, we analyze the effects that different sample patch sizes have on the predictive performance of the algorithms. As case study we selected the fire occurrences in two regions in Chile, from 2013 to 2019. Satellite imagery data for fifteen fire influencing factors in the study area were retrieved to build a dataset to extract the samples to train the models. These factors include elevation, aspect, surface roughness, slope, minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, climatic water deficit, NDVI, land cover type, distance to rivers, distance to roads and distance to urban areas. During training, the best sample patch size was found to be 25 × 25 pixels. As a result, the highest area under the curve (AUC) was 0.953 achieved by the Ensemble model, followed by CNN-1 with AUC = 0.902. The Ensemble model also achieved the best accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and F1 score. Finally, the predicted susceptibility maps suggest that static variables can be considered as predisposing factors, while dynamic variables affect the intensity of the predicted probabilities, with an important role of the anthropogenic variables. These resulting maps may be useful to prioritize wildfire surveillance and monitoring in extensive high risk areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Convolutional neural network; Forestry; Geographical information systems; Satellite imagery; Wildfire susceptibility,Chile; climate change; detection method; evapotranspiration; forest fire; land classification; land cover; machine learning; mapping method; NDVI; patch size; pixel; precipitation (climatology); satellite imagery; surface roughness; wildfire

To this end, we used a combination of data from geostationary satellites and polar orbit satellites to correct the FRP data. Incorporating various factors that affect wildfire spread, such as meteorological conditions, topography, vegetation indexes, and population density, we constructed a comprehensive California wildfire spread dataset, covering information since 2017. Then, we established a deep learning framework that integrates various modules to analyze multimodal data for the accurate prediction of FRP imagery. We investigated the impact of input sequence length and loss function design on model predictive performance, leading to subsequent model optimization. Furthermore, our model has demonstrated acceptable performance in transfer learning and multistep prediction, emphasizing its application value in wildfire prediction and management.

In addition, powerful computational tools are essential for predicting certain burned area in the duration of a forest fire. The reason of this study is to built up a smart system based on semantic neural networking for the forecast of burned areas. The usage of virtual reality simulator is used to support the instruction process of fire fighters and all users for saving of surrounded wild lives by using a naive method Semantic Neural Network System (SNNS).

However, such analyses have traditionally been conducted at local or national scales, hindering cross-border comparisons and the formulation of broad-scale policy initiatives. In this study, we present an analysis of the spatial variability of wildfire initiations across Europe, focusing specifically on moderate to large fires (> 100 ha), and examining the influence of both human and climatic factors on initiation areas. We estimated drivers of fire initiation using machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), covering the majority of the European territory (referred to as the “ET scale”). The models were trained using data on fire initiations extracted from a satellite burned area product, comprising fires occurring from 2001 to 2019. We developed six RF models: three considering all fires larger than 100 ha, and three focused solely on the largest events (> 1000 ha). Models were developed using climatic and human predictors separately, as well as both types of predictors mixed together. We found that both climatic and mixed models demonstrated moderate predictive capacity, with AUC values ranging from 79 % to 81 %; while models based only on human variables have had poor predictive capacity (AUC of 60 %). Feature importance analysis, using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), allowed us to assess the primary drivers of wildfire initiations across the European Territory. Aridity and evapotranspiration had the strongest effect on fire initiation. Among human variables, population density and aging had considerable effects on fire initiation, the former with a strong effect in mixed models estimating large fires, while the latter had a more important role in the prediction of very large fires. Distance to roads and forest-agriculture interfaces were also relevant in some initiation models. A better understanding of drivers of main fire events should help designing European forest fire management strategies, particularly in the light of growing importance of climate change, as it would affect both fire severity and areas at risk. Factors of fire initiation should also be part of a comprehensive approach for fire risk assessment, reduction and adaption, contributing to more effective wildfire management and mitigation across the continent. © 2024 The Authors",Fire; Fire risk; Forest fires; Human factors; Ignition probability,Europe; Climate change; Deforestation; Factor analysis; Fire hazards; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Anthropogenic factors; Climatic factors; Complex roles; Fire initiation; Fire risks; Forest fires; Ignition probability; Mixed modeling; Predictive capacity; Scale analysis; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; aridity; climate change; evapotranspiration; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; risk assessment; spatial variation; wildfire; aging; agriculture; Aridity Index; Article; climate; climate change; controlled study; environmental parameters; Europe; evapotranspiration; fire; forest; forest fire; geographic distribution; human; human impact (environment); machine learning; population density; population research; prediction; probability; random forest; risk assessment; rural area; sensitivity analysis; Shapley Additive Explanation; spatial analysis; urban area; wildfire; article; burn patient; Europe; fire; fire protection; forest fire; learning algorithm; machine learning; probability; Fires
Qian J.; Lin H.,"Qian, Jingjing (57880225900); Lin, Haifeng (36640121300)",A Forest Fire Identification System Based On Weighted Fusion Algorithm,2022,Forests,"The occurrence of forest fires causes serious damage to ecological diversity and the safety of people’s property and life. However, due to the complex forest environment, the changeable shape of forest fires, and the uncertainty of flame color and texture, forest fire detection becomes very difficult. Traditional image processing methods rely heavily on artificial features and are not generally applicable to different forest fire scenes. In order to solve the problem of inaccurate forest fire recognition caused by the manual extraction of features, some scholars use deep learning technology to adaptively learn and extract forest fire features, but they often use a single target detection model, and their lack of learning and perception makes it difficult for them to accurately identify forest fires in a complex forest fire environment. Therefore, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the manual extraction of features and achieve a higher accuracy of forest fire recognition, this paper proposes an algorithm based on weighted fusion to identify forest fire sources in different scenarios, fuses two independent weakly supervised models Yolov5 and EfficientDet, completes the training and prediction of data sets in parallel, and uses the weighted boxes fusion algorithm (WBF) to process the prediction results to obtain the fusion frame. Finally, the model is evaluated by Microsoft COCO standard. Experimental results show that compared with Yolov5 and EfficientDet, the proposed Y4SED improves the detection performance by 2.5% to 4.5%. The fused algorithm proposed in this paper has better feature extraction ability, can extract more forest fire feature information, and better balances the recognition accuracy and complexity of the model, which provides a reference for forest fire target detection in the real environment. © 2022 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; deep learning; feature extraction; forest fire identification; integrated learning,Accuracy; Deforestation; Detection; Extraction; Forest Fires; Fusion; Paper; Deep learning; Deforestation; Extraction; Fire hazards; Fires; Image processing; Learning systems; Textures; Complex forests; Deep learning; Features extraction; Fire features; Fire recognition; Forest fire identification; Forest fires; Fusion algorithms; Integrated learning; Weighted fusion; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial intelligence; experimental study; forest fire; hazard management; identification method; safety; Feature extraction

Fire risk maps are an effective tool to quantify regional fire risk. Most existing studies on forest fire risk maps mainly use a single machine learning model, but different models have varying degrees of feature extraction in the same spatial environment, leading to inconsistencies in prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel integrated machine learning framework that systematically evaluates multiple models and combines their outputs through a weighted ensemble approach, thereby enhancing prediction robustness. During the feature selection stage, factors including socio-economic, climate, terrain, remote sensing data, and human factors were considered. Unlike previous studies that mainly use a single model, eight models were evaluated and compared using performance metrics. Three models were weighted based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) values, and cross-validation results showed an improvement in model performance. The integrated model achieved an accuracy of 0.8602, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.772, and superior sensitivity (0.9234), outperforming individual models. Finally, the weighted framework was applied to generate a fire risk map.

Accurate quantitative prediction of forest fire spread is essential for devising swift risk management strategies and implementing effective firefighting approaches. In response to this imperative, this study introduces a Forest Fire Spread Behavior Prediction (FFSBP) model, encompassing two integral components: the Forest Fire Spread Process Prediction (FFSPP) model and the Forest Fire Spread Results Prediction (FFSRP) model. The FFSPP model involves the prediction of the direction and speed of forest fire spread, achieved through a fusion of the Cellular Automata model and the Wang Zhengfei model. On the other hand, the FFSRP model focuses on forecasting the extent of the burned area, leveraging machine learning methods. To validate the efficacy of the proposed models, a real case study is undertaken using the '3.29 Forest Fire' incident in China. The FFSPP model is validated against this case, while the FFSRP model is assessed using a real fire dataset obtained from Montesinho National Forest Park in Portugal. Results from the validation process reveal that during the natural development period of the '3.29 Forest Fire,' the FFSPP model predicts a burned area of 286.81 hm2, with an associated relative error of 28.94%. This relative error is notably smaller than those observed in the Farsite and Prometheus fire behavior simulation models. Additionally, the FFSRP model demonstrates commendable predictive performance, particularly in the context of small and medium-sized fire scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of the FFSBP model as a valuable tool in enhancing forest fire prediction accuracy and facilitating more robust risk mitigation and firefighting strategies.  © 2013 IEEE.",cellular automata; Forest fire prediction; forest fire spread; machine learning; Wang Zhengfei model,Artificial intelligence; Biological systems; Cellular automata; Deforestation; Disasters; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Learning systems; Risk management; Biological system modeling; Cellular automatons; Computational modelling; Forest fire prediction; Forest fire spread; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Predictive models; Wang zhengfei model; Fires

The majority of forest fires in South Korea are caused by humans. Over the past decade, more than half of these types of fires occurred during the spring season. Although human activities are the primary cause of forest fires, the fact that they are concentrated in the spring underscores the strong association between forest fires and meteorological factors. When meteorological conditions favor the occurrence of forest fires, certain triggering factors can lead to their ignition more easily. The purpose of this study is to analyze the meteorological factors influencing forest fires and to develop a machine learning-based prediction model for forest fire occurrence, focusing on meteorological data. The study focuses on four regions within Gangwon province in South Korea, which have experienced substantial damage from forest fires. To construct the model, historical meteorological data were collected, surrogate variables were calculated, and a variable selection process was applied to identify relevant meteorological factors. Five machine learning models were then used to predict forest fire occurrence and ensemble techniques were employed to enhance the model’s performance. The performance of the developed forest fire prediction model was evaluated using evaluation metrics. The results indicate that the ensemble model outperformed the individual models, with a higher F1-score and a notable reduction in false positives compared to the individual models. This suggests that the model developed in this study, when combined with meteorological forecast data, can potentially predict forest fire occurrence and provide insights into the expected severity of fires.

To address this, our study applies the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to select the optimal parameters of the RF model, with the goal of enhancing model performance. We employ the optimized ensemble model (PSO-RF) to create a fire risk map for Jiushan National Forest Park in Anhui Province, China, thereby filling the research gap in this region’s forest fire studies. Based on collinearity tests and previous research results, we selected eight fire driving factors, including topography, climate, human activities, and vegetation for modeling. Additionally, we compare the logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and RF models. Lastly, we select the optimal model to evaluate feature importance and generate the fire risk map. Model evaluation results demonstrate that the PSO-RF model performs best (AUC = 0.908), followed by RF (0.877), SVM (0.876), and LR (0.846). In the fire risk map created by the PSO-RF model, 70.73% of the area belongs to the normal management zone, while 15.23% is classified as a fire alert zone. The feature importance analysis of the PSO-RF model reveals that the NDVI is the key fire driving factor in this study area. Through utilizing the PSO algorithm to optimize the RF model, we have addressed the subjective and empirical problems of the RF model hyperparameter setting, thereby enhancing the model’s accuracy and generalization ability. © 2023 by the authors.",fire risk map; forest fire prediction; machine learning; PSO-RF,Deforestation; Driving; Fires; Machinery; Maps; Performance; Research; Topography; Anhui; China; Brain; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Logistic regression; Maps; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Random forests; Support vector machines; Topography; Fire risk map; Fire risks; Forest fire prediction; Machine-learning; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization-random forest; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Risk maps; Swarm optimization; algorithm; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; optimization; regression analysis; Fires

A more reliable susceptibility map helps improve the effectiveness of resource allocation. Thus, further improving the prediction accuracy is always the goal of fire susceptibility modeling. This paper developed a forest fire susceptibility model based on an ensemble learning method, namely light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to produce an accurate fire susceptibility map. In the modeling, a subtropical national forest park in the Jiangsu province of China was used as the case study area. We collected and selected eight variables from the fire occurrence driving factors for modeling based on correlation analysis. These variables are from topographic factors, climatic factors, human activity factors, and vegetation factors. For comparative analysis, another two popular modeling methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were also applied to construct the fire susceptibility models. The results show that temperature was the main driving factor of fire in the area. In the produced fire susceptibility map, the extremely high and high susceptibility areas that were classified by LR, RF, and LightGBM were 5.82%, 18.61%, and 19%, respectively. The F1-score of the LightGBM model is higher than the LR and RF models. The accuracy of the model of LightGBM, RF, and LR is 88.8%, 84.8%, and 82.6%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of them is 0.935, 0.918, and 0.868, respectively.

This approach is partially knowledge-driven and partially data-driven. It exploits active fire points to train the fusion function of factors deemed influential in determining the evidence of burned conditions from reflectance values of multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) data. The fusion function is used to compute a map of seeds (burned pixels) that are adaptively expanded by applying a Region Growing (RG) algorithm to generate the final burned area map. The fusion function is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator, learnt through the application of a machine learning (ML) algorithm from a set of highly reliable fire points. Its semantics are characterized by two measures, the degrees of pessimism/optimism and democracy/monarchy. The former allows the prediction of the results of the fusion as affected by more false positives (commission errors) than false negatives (omission errors) in the case of pessimism, or vice versa; the latter foresees if there are only a few highly influential factors or many low influential ones that determine the result. The prediction on the degree of pessimism/optimism allows the expansion of the seeds to be appropriately tuned by selecting the most suited growing layer for the RG algorithm thus adapting the algorithm to the context. The paper illustrates the application of the automatic method in four study areas in southern Europe to map burned areas for the 2017 fire season. Thematic accuracy at each site was assessed by comparison to reference perimeters to prove the adaptability of the approach to the context; estimated average accuracy metrics are omission error = 0.057, commission error = 0.068, Dice coefficient = 0.94 and relative bias = 0.0046. © 2021 by the author.

Physics-driven models, such as cellular automata and computational fluid dynamics can provide high-fidelity fire spread simulations but they are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Much effort has been put into developing machine learning models for fire prediction. However, these models are often region-specific and require a substantial quantity of simulation data for training purpose. This results in a significant amount of computational effort for different ecoregions. In this work, a generative model is proposed using a three-dimensional Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders to generate spatial-temporal sequences of unseen wildfire burned areas in a given ecoregion. The model is tested in the ecoregion of a recent massive wildfire event in California, known as the Chimney fire. Numerical results show that the model succeed in generating coherent and structured fire scenarios, taking into account the impact from geophysical variables, such as vegetation and slope.

First, the DCNN network model was trained in combination with transfer learning, and multiple pre-trained DCNN models were used to extract features from forest fire images. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) reconstruction technology was used in the appropriate subspace. The constructed 15-layer forest fire risk identification DCNN model named “DCN_Fire” could accurately identify core fire insurance areas.

The traditional DCNN model was improved and the recognition speed and accuracy were compared and analyzed with the other three DCNN model algorithms with different architectures. The difficulty of using DCNN to monitor forest fire risk was solved, and the model’s detection accuracy was further improved. The true positive rate was 7.41% and the false positive rate was 4.8%. When verifying the impact of different batch sizes and loss rates on verification accuracy, the loss rate of the DCN_Fire model of 0.5 and the batch size of 50 provided the optimal value for verification accuracy (0.983).

While landscape models can predict erosion from burned areas using the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), post-fire erosion modeling has predominantly focused on areas that have recently burned. Here, we developed and validated a predictive burn severity model that produces continuous dNBR predictions for recently unburned forest land in Utah.ResultsVegetation productivity, elevation, and canopy fuels were the most important predictor variables in the model, highlighting the strong control of fuels and vegetation on burn severity in Utah. Final model out-of-bag R2 was 67.1%, residuals showed a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and classification accuracy into three classes was 85%. We demonstrated that dNBR can be empirically modeled relative to fuels and topography and found burn severity was highest in productive vegetation and at relatively cooler sites.ConclusionsWe found that prediction accuracy was higher when fuel moisture was lower, suggesting drier weather conditions drive more consistent and predictable burn severity patterns across a range of burn severity, vegetation types, and geographic locations. Moreover, burn severity predictions from this model can be used to inform hydro-erosion models and subsequent management actions aimed at reducing burn severity and post-wildfire erosion risks.

Applying machine learning (ML) models enhances accuracy and reduces the computational time required to predict bushfire ignition.

It is challenging to thoroughly investigate patterns of fire occurrence and fire distribution for predicting wildfire behaviour, and it is especially difficult to distinguish the characteristics of human-caused and climate-driven fires. Here, we identify and assess dense-fire (DF) from the perspective of spatiotemporally integrated processes using a machine-learning method based on a density-based clustering algorithm with noise constraint ratio. DFs represent collections of fires with homogenous behaviour and therefore allow the study of their internal features, which can reveal fixed patterns of fire occurrence and distribution as well as the evolution of fires over time. We estimated and labelled thousands of fire clusters on the Indochina Peninsula between 2010 and 2020, most of which occurred between December and May. For large-scale DFs, the number of fires contained and amount of atmospheric pollutants emitted were accounted for throughout most of the region, and the time, location and scale of their occurrence each year were relatively stable and predictable. Furthermore, the results of a secondary cluster analysis of fire interactions over the past decade showed two extreme fire events, labelled”north” and”south” groups, whose activities significantly impacted the atmospheric environment of the Indochina Peninsula. Additionally, we predicted their start/end dates and daily emissions. The study also found that the recurrence of high-density fires and the correlation between the DF edge and administrative border suggested a positive anthropogenic influence. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to analyze fires in a spatiotemporal Euclidean space by using density-based clustering, with high-density fires as independent subjects to study fire behaviour.

Numerous research efforts have leveraged remote sensing and machine learning for classifying land cover and mapping forest vegetation species. In most cases that focused on surface fuel mapping, the spatial scale of interest was smaller than a few hundred square kilometers; thus, many small-scale site-specific models had to be created to cover the landscape at the national scale. The present work aims to develop a large-scale surface fuel identification model using a custom deep learning framework that can ingest multimodal data. Specifically, we use deep learning to extract information from multispectral signatures, high-resolution imagery, and biophysical climate and terrain data in a way that facilitates their end-to-end training on labeled data. A multi-layer neural network is used with spectral and biophysical data, and a convolutional neural network backbone is used to extract the visual features from high-resolution imagery. A Monte Carlo dropout mechanism was also devised to create a stochastic ensemble of models that can capture classification uncertainties while boosting the prediction performance. To train the system as a proof-of-concept, fuel pseudo-labels were created by a random geospatial sampling of existing fuel maps across California. Application results on independent test sets showed promising fuel identification performance with an overall accuracy ranging from 55% to 75%, depending on the level of granularity of the included fuel types. As expected, including the rare—and possibly less consequential—fuel types reduced the accuracy. On the other hand, the addition of high-resolution imagery improved classification performance at all levels. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; deep learning; fuel mapping; machine learning; remote sensing; wildland fire,

Among the top 20 California wildfires, those in 2020–2021 burned more acres than the last century combined. Lack of an adequate early warning system impacts the health and safety of vulnerable populations disproportionately and widens the inequality gap. In this project, a multi-modal wildfire prediction and early warning system has been developed based on a novel spatio-temporal machine learning architecture. A comprehensive wildfire database with over 37 million data points was created, including the historical wildfires, environmental and meteorological sensor data from the Environmental Protection Agency, and geological data. The data was augmented into 2.53 km × 2.53 km square grids to overcome the sensor network coverage limitations. Leading and trailing indicators for the wildfires are proposed, classified, and tested. The leading indicators are correlated to the risks of wildfire conception, whereas the trailing indicators are correlated to the byproducts of the wildfires. Additionally, geological data was incorporated to provide additional information for better assessment on wildfire risks and propagation. Next, a novel U-Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ULSTM) neural network was developed to extract key spatial and temporal features of the dataset, specifically to address the spatial nature of the location of the wildfire and time-progression temporal nature of the wildfire evolution. Through iterative improvements and optimization, the final ULSTM network architecture, trained with data from 2012 to 2017, achieved >97% accuracy for predicting wildfires in 2018, as compared to ∼76% using traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques.

To address these issues, we propose a novel algorithm, squeeze-excitation spatial multi-scale transformer learning (SESMTML), which is designed to extract multi-scale fire danger features from remote sensing images. SESMTML includes several key modules: the multi-scale deep feature extraction module (MSDFEM) captures global visual and multi-scale convolutional features, the multi-scale fire danger perception module (MFDPM) explores contextual relationships, the multi-scale information aggregation module (MIAM) aggregates correlations of multi-level fire danger features, and the fire danger level fusion module (FDLFM) integrates the contributions of global and multi-level features for predicting forest fire danger. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s significant superiority, achieving an accuracy of 83.18%, representing a 22.58% improvement over previous models and outperforming many widely used deep learning methods. Additionally, a detailed forest fire danger prediction map was generated using a test study area at the junction of the Miyun and Pinggu districts in Beijing, further confirming the model’s effectiveness.

This research proposes and evaluates a new modeling approach based on TensorFlow deep neural networks (TFDeepNN) and geographic information systems (GIS) for forest fire danger modeling. Herein, TFDeepNN was used to create a forest fire danger model, whereas the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimization algorithm was used to optimize the model, and GIS with Python programming was used to process, classify, and code the input and output. The modeling focused on the tropical forests of the Phu Yen Province (Vietnam), which incorporates 306 historical forest fire locations from 2019 to 2023 and ten forest-fire-driving factors. Random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) were used as a baseline for the model comparison. Different statistical metrics, such as F-score, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve (AUC), were employed to evaluate the models' predictive performance. According to the results, the TFDeepNN model (with F-score of 0.806, accuracy of 79.3%, and AUC of 0.873) exhibits high predictive performance and surpasses the performance of the three baseline models: RF, SVM, and LR; therefore, TFDeepNN represents a novel tool for spatially predicting forest fire danger.

To predict and generate wildfire susceptibility maps to visualize the probability of wildfire occurrence intuitively, we propose a Clustering-based Resampling with the Cost-sensitive Boosting (CRCBoost) method. Emphasizing the highly cluster-able feature vectors in wildfire imbalance data overlooked by previous studies, CRCBoost adopts a clustering-based resampling strategy in each iteration of boosting and sets various misclassification costs for positive and negative samples to be more sensitive for identifying the fire points. Due to the frequent wildfires in two contract counties (Los Angeles and Ventura) in California, USA, they are set as the study area. Data regarding historical wildfires, geographical, meteorological, and vegetation features are collected for the period spanning 2010 to 2020. A recursive feature elimination algorithm is used for filtering out irrelevant features. CRCBoost is more suitable for short-term wildfire occurrence prediction and its performance is demonstrated to be better than other popular machine learning methods. Generating wildfire susceptibility maps and calculating feature importance are helpful to identify areas of high wildfire susceptibility and main drivers.

This research aims to develop a new ensemble learning model, HHO-RSCDT, capable of accurately predicting spatial patterns of forest fire danger. The HHO-RSCDT method combines three distinct components, namely Random Subspace (RS), Credal Decision Tree (CDT), and Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO). Herein, RS generates a series of subspace datasets, which are subsequently utilized to produce individual CDT classifiers. Then, HHO optimizes the ensemble model, enabling the model to achieve higher predictive performance. The model was trained and validated using a forest fire dataset at Phu Yen province, Vietnam. The dataset includes 306 forest fire locations and ten influencing factors from the study province.

However, in the Federal District, wildfire hazards have risen due to wildfires reaching several of its protected areas. Wildfire occurrence/incidence risk refers to the likelihood or probability of a wildfire event occurring in a particular geographic area. The risk is typically determined by factors such as weather conditions, topography, vegetation, and human activities and often measured through analyses of historical wildfire data and predictive models that estimate the likelihood of future wildfire events. High wildfire occurrence/incidence risk areas are those more likely to experience a wildfire incident, whereas low-risk ones are less susceptible to it. This study compares 8 machine learning models that predict wildfire occurrence risk worldwide so that they can be adopted in Brazil. They considered correlations among climate conditions, spatial location, topographic features, anthropogenic explanatory features, and fire occurrence and a dataset enriched with Brazilian governmental open data was comprised of observations on 16 climate features of 5 monitoring stations and satellite data on fires occurred over the past two decades and topographic, hydrographic, and anthropogenic features, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), urbanization index, and distance to rivers/roads.

To mitigate the ecological damage caused by forest fires, it was necessary to develop prediction models of fire risk. In this study, by evolving the optimal architecture and parameters using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model was proposed to predict forest fire risk on a national scale. Utilizing fire data and fire risk factors from 2001 to 2020 in China, the PSO-CNN-based deep learning model (PSO-CNN) was utilized and tested.

The mapping of wildfires is particularly important for fire prediction and burned biomass estimation. Therefore, accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is of great importance and has a key role in disaster management. Estimation of burned areas from multispectral datasets is challenging, because of the complexity of the background and the different reflections of wildfires on the targets. To this end, this study presents a novel burned-area mapping framework based on the fusion of multitemporal Sentinel-1 coherence imagery and post-event Sentinel-2 imagery. The proposed framework uses hybrid quadratic morphological (QM) operations and convolution layers for deep feature extraction. The proposed architecture is known as the QMDNN-Net, where the overall framework of QMDNN-Net is based on a deep Siamese network. QMDNN-Net has double streams for extracting deep features from multitemporal coherence data and Sentinel-2 imagery. The streams are similar to each other and have the same number of group-dilated convolution blocks and QM layers. QMDNN-Net is defined based on quadratic dilation and erosion, and then it takes the average of these as output.

Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods - including deep learning and agent-based learning - in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application.

The study area is Yunnan Province, situated in southwest China, is dominated by mountainous landscapes and exhibits a significant susceptibility to wildfires. A spatial weighting model was developed using historical wildfire data (2011–2020), and threshold values were applied to divide different non-fire sample collection ranges.

Effectively suppressing large wildfires requires a thorough understanding of containment opportunities across landscapes, to which empirical spatial modelling can contribute largely. The previous containment model in Catalonia failed to account for the crucial roles of weather conditions, lacked temporal prediction and could not forecast windows for containment opportunities, prompting this research. We employed a detailed geospatial approach to assess the spatial-temporal variations in containment probability for escaped wildfires in Catalonia. Using machine learning algorithms, geospatial data, and 124 historical wildfire perimeters from 2000 to 2015, we developed a predictive model with high accuracy (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve = 0.81 ± 0.03) over 32,108 km2 at a 30-meter resolution. Our analysis identified agricultural plains near non-burnable barriers, such as major road corridors, as having the highest containment probability. Conversely, steep mountainous regions with limited accessibility exhibited lower containment success rates. We also found temperature and windspeed to be critical factors influencing containment success.

This study integrated multiple factors, including topography, climate, vegetation, and human activities, and employed machine learning models, specifically random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN), to predict forest fire occurrence in Jiangxi. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer L3 fire-point data from 2001-2020, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires and applied the weight of evidence (WoE) method to evaluate the correlation between forest fires and environmental factors. WoE was employed to select negative samples, which were compared with those obtained using traditional random sampling methods. The optimal model was then utilized to generate seasonal spatial distribution maps of forest fire risk throughout Jiangxi Province. The results showed that over the past two decades, the frequency of forest fires generally decreased. RF demonstrated a significant advantage over SVM and BPNN in predicting forest fires. Vegetation coverage was the most influential factor. In addition, the models trained with WoE-selected negative samples exhibited enhanced accuracy, with area under the curve values increasing from 0.946 to 0.995 for RF, 0.8344 to 0.925 for SVM, and 0.832 to 0.850 for BPNN, compared to those trained with randomly sampled negative data. Finally, forest fires were most frequent during winter, particularly in Ganzhou, Fuzhou, and Ji'an. High-risk fire zones were more dispersed in spring, whereas autumn fires were primarily concentrated in Ganzhou, and fire activity was relatively low during summer.

Despite ongoing prevention efforts, large-scale fires continue to devastate vast areas of forest and agricultural land, a situation exacerbated by climate change and human activities. Proactive approaches are essential to mitigate this phenomenon, requiring reliable and robust susceptibility models. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of wildfire susceptibility models by incorporating a temporal perspective into the assessment of machine learning models. Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on spatial validation, this research integrates temporal analysis to assess the accuracy of future predictions. Focusing on the province of Jijel, Algeria, the study employs six well established machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting (HGB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression (LR)—to assess the wildfire exposure. The findings reveal that temporal sampling in wildfire susceptibility models decreases performance by 2–20% compared to spatial sampling, indicating the significant influence of temporal aspect on model reliability and overestimation due to data partitioning based solely on spatial sampling. Additionally, the study highlights a trade-off between performance and reliability: while HGB emerges as the best-performing model, its reliability is relatively low.

Fuels, climate, weather, and the landscape all exert controls on wildfire occurrence and spread, but the dynamics of these controls vary from daily to decadal timescales. Accurate spatial predictions of large wildfires should therefore strive to integrate across these variables and timescales. Here, we describe a high spatial resolution dataset (250m pixel) of the probability of large wildfires ( > 405 ha) across forests and woodlands in the contiguous western US, from 2005 to the present. The dataset is automatically updated on a weekly basis using Google Earth Engine and a continuous integration pipeline. Each image in the dataset is the output of a random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on random samples of historic small and large wildfires and represents the predicted conditional probability of an individual pixel burning in a large fire, given an ignition or fire spread to that pixel. This novel workflow is able to integrate the near- term dynamics of fuels and weather into weekly predictions while also integrating longer-term dynamics of fuels, the climate, and the landscape. As a continually updated product, the dataset can provide operational fire managers with contemporary, onthe- ground information to closely monitor the changing potential for large wildfire occurrence and spread. It can also serve as a foundational dataset for longer-term planning and research, such as the strategic targeting of fuels management, fire-smart development at the wildland-urban interface, and the analysis of trends in wildfire potential over time.

This study aimed to propose novel solutions to their two primary limitations, including the lack of robust fuel classification method and the low spatial resolution of wildfire growth accuracy assessment while ensuring wide applicability using open data satellite missions and software. The first objective was to create a robust two-step fuel model classification method consisted of the supervised machine learning classification of generalized land cover classes in the 1st level and their individual unsupervised classification to vegetation subtypes in the 2nd level. The second objective was creating a wildfire prediction accuracy assessment method using MODIS 250 m images, which overcome the limitations of low spatial resolution while preserving sub-daily temporal resolution. The wildfire on the Korčula island in Croatia was analyzed in the study, being specific for its long duration from 18 to 24 July 2015. The wildfire ignition occurred in the isolated area, which prolonged the response time from emergency agencies. Random Forest (RF) with input Landsat 8 spectral bands and indices resulted in the highest classification accuracy in the 1st classification level with an overall agreement of 83.6%. The vegetation subclasses from the 2nd classification level were matched to the 13 standard fuel models for the input in FARSITE software. The predicted wildfire evaluation showed the highest mean accuracy of 0.906 for the first two days, which decreased to 0.722 in the latter stages of the active wildfire caused by overprediction. The proposed two-step fuel model classification presented a cost-efficient solution to the fuel map creation in any part of the world, with a disadvantage of no in-situ ground truth identification and accuracy assessment for 2nd classification level. The evaluation of wildfire growth prediction with 250 m images enabled high spatial and temporal resolution of the assessment, while its limitations of wildfire overprediction and the negative effects of wildfire smoke in MODIS images should be addressed in future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",FARSITE; Forest fire; Fuel model; Landsat 8; Machine learning; MODIS,Croatia; Smoke; Wildfires; Croatia; Climate change; Deforestation; Fires; Forecasting; Image resolution; Learning systems; Open Data; Radiometers; Smoke; Supervised learning; Vegetation; Accuracy assessment; Classification methods; FARSITE; Forest fires; Fuel model; LANDSAT; Landsat 8; Machine-learning; MODIS; Spatial resolution; accuracy assessment; global climate; land cover; Landsat; machine learning; MODIS; satellite data; unsupervised classification; wildfire; article; Croatia; forest fire; land use; prediction; random forest; reaction time; satellite imagery; smoke; software; supervised machine learning; wildfire; wildfire; Landsat

However, traditional approaches often rely on fixed thresholds and supervised learning techniques, which may fail to account for the complex spatiotemporal dynamics associated with forest fire events. To overcome this limitation, an adaptive deep learning model is proposed and specifically designed for early forest fire monitoring. This model integrates Stacking ConvLSTM to forecast mid-infrared brightness temperatures and employs a non-parametric dynamic thresholding method based on Otsu's algorithm for spatiotemporal anomaly detection, facilitating the identification of potential hotspots. By effectively capturing complex dependencies within spatiotemporal dimensions, this method improves detection accuracy. Furthermore, high-confidence early fire points are determined through dual-band analysis and land cover detection. Comparative experiments utilizing Himawari-8/9 satellite data reveal that the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques as well as the latest temporal methods, achieving an accuracy of 0.995, precision of 0.985, recall of 0.946, and an F1 score of 0.965. Additionally, our method demonstrates an average fire detection delay of just 7 minutes and an average runtime of 71 seconds, underscoring its effectiveness in early forest fire detection.

Accurately forecasting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) is crucial for mitigating wildfire risks and protecting ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure. This study analyzed FWI trends across the Continental United States (CONUS) from 2014 to 2023, using meteorological data from the gridMET dataset. Key variables, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, were utilized to calculate the FWI at a fine spatial resolution of 4 km, ensuring the precise identification of wildfire-prone areas. Based on this, our study developed a hybrid modeling framework to forecast FWI over a 14-day horizon, integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Autoregressive Networks (DeepAR). The models were evaluated using the Index of Agreement (IOA) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results revealed that the Southwest and West regions of CONUS consistently exhibited the highest mean FWI values, with the summer months demonstrating the greatest variability across all climatic zones. In terms of model performance on forecasting, Day 1 results highlighted the superior performance of the GNN-TCNN model, achieving an IOA of 0.95 and an RMSE of 1.21, compared to the GNN-LSTM (IOA: 0.93, RMSE: 1.25) and GNN-DeepAR (IOA: 0.92, RMSE: 1.30). On average, across all 14 days, the GNN-TCNN outperformed others with a mean IOA of 0.885 and an RMSE of 1.325, followed by the GNN-LSTM (IOA: 0.852, RMSE: 1.590) and GNN-DeepAR (IOA: 0.8225, RMSE: 1.755). The GNN-TCNN demonstrated robust accuracy across short-term (days 1–7) and long-term (days 8–14) forecasts.

Satellite remote sensing technology plays a pivotal role in wildfire monitoring and risk assessment, providing extensive geographical coverage and continuous monitoring capabilities. Traditional methods for predicating wildfire risk, however, face limitations in processing large-scale remote sensing data, especially in cloud detection and temporal information analysis. In response to this challenge, a novel set of image processing algorithms has been developed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of wildfire risk prediction. Initially, a cloud detection and removal algorithm based on deep learning is introduced. This algorithm effectively identifies and eliminates cloud interference in remote sensing images, thereby significantly improving the quality and usability of image data. Subsequently, a temporal information capturing technique is proposed, capable of processing vast amounts of remote sensing data and extracting time series features. This technique provides robust data support for wildfire risk prediction. The application of these technologies not only improves the efficiency of the data processing workflow but also enhances the timeliness and accuracy of the prediction model, holding significant practical importance for guiding actual wildfire prevention and response measures. © 2024 by the authors of this article.",cloud detection; deep learning; image processing algorithm; satellite remote sensing; temporal information; wildfire risk prediction,Data handling; Deep learning; Efficiency; Fires; Forecasting; Global warming; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Remote sensing; Satellites; Cloud detection; Deep learning; Image processing algorithm; Large-scales; Remote sensing data; Risk predictions; Satellite remote sensing; Temporal information; Wildfire risk prediction; Wildfire risks; Risk assessment

"Ide, R; Yang, L","Ide, Ryo; Yang, Lei",Adversarial Robustness For Deep Learning-based Wildfire Prediction Models,2025,FIRE-SWITZERLAND,"Rapidly growing wildfires have recently devastated societal assets, exposing a critical need for early warning systems to expedite relief efforts. Smoke detection using camera-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offers a promising solution for wildfire prediction. However, the rarity of smoke across time and space limits training data, raising model overfitting and bias concerns. Current DNNs, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, complicate robustness evaluation due to architectural differences. To address these challenges, we introduce WARP (Wildfire Adversarial Robustness Procedure), the first model-agnostic framework for evaluating wildfire detection models' adversarial robustness. WARP addresses inherent limitations in data diversity by generating adversarial examples through image-global and -local perturbations. Global and local attacks superimpose Gaussian noise and PNG patches onto image inputs, respectively; this suits both CNNs and transformers while generating realistic adversarial scenarios. Using WARP, we assessed real-time CNNs and Transformers, uncovering key vulnerabilities. At times, transformers exhibited over 70% precision degradation under global attacks, while both models generally struggled to differentiate cloud-like PNG patches from real smoke during local attacks. To enhance model robustness, we proposed four wildfire-oriented data augmentation techniques based on WARP's methodology and results, which diversify smoke image data and improve model precision and robustness. These advancements represent a substantial step toward developing a reliable early wildfire warning system, which may be our first safeguard against wildfire destruction.",wildfire; smoke; adversarial robustness; computer vision; deep neural networks; noise,

The demand for risk assessment is increasing due to the escalating severity of wildfires. A quick and cost-effective method is required to mitigate foreseeable disasters. In this study, a method for tree detection and fuel amount and distribution prediction using aerial images was proposed for a low-cost and efficient acquisition of fuel information. Three-dimensional (3D) fuel information (height) from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) was matched to two-dimensional (2D) fuel information (crown width) from aerial photographs to establish a statistical prediction model in northeastern South Korea. Quantile regression for 0.05, 0.5, and 0.95 quantiles was performed. Subsequently, an allometric tree model was used to predict the diameter at the breast height. The performance of the prediction model was validated using physically measured data by laser distance meter triangulation and direct measurement from a field survey. The predicted quantile, 0.5, was adequately matched to the measured quantile, 0.5, and most of the measured values lied within the predicted quantiles, 0.05 and 0.95. Therefore, in the developed prediction model, only 2D images were required to predict a few of the 3D fuel details.

In southern California (USA), the Rowe, Countryman, and Storey (RCS) 1949 methodology is an empirical method that is used to rapidly estimate post-fire peak streamflow. We re-evaluated the accuracy of RCS for 33 watersheds under current conditions. Pre-fire peak streamflow prediction performance was low, where the average R2 was 0.29 and average RMSE was 1.10 cms/km2 for the 2- and 10-year recurrence interval events, respectively. Post-fire, RCS performance was also low, with an average R2 of 0.26 and RMSE of 15.77 cms/km2 for the 2- and 10-year events. We demonstrated that RCS overgeneralizes watershed processes and does not adequately represent the spatial and temporal variability in systems affected by wildfire and extreme weather events and often underpredicted peak streamflow without sediment bulking factors. A novel application of machine learning was used to identify critical watershed characteristics including local physiography, land cover, geology, slope, aspect, rainfall intensity, and soil burn severity, resulting in two random forest models with 45 and five parameters (RF-45 and RF-5, respectively) to predict post-fire peak streamflow. RF-45 and RF-5 performed better than the RCS method; however, they demonstrated the importance and reliance on data availability. The important parameters identified by the machine learning techniques were used to create a three-dimensional polynomial function to calculate post-fire peak streamflow in small catchments in southern California during the first year after fire (R2 = 0.82; RMSE = 6.59 cms/km2) which can be used as an interim tool by post-fire risk assessment teams. We conclude that a significant increase in data collection of high temporal and spatial resolution rainfall intensity, streamflow, and sediment loading in channels will help to guide future model development to quantify post-fire flood risk. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","flooding; post-fire peak streamflow; random forest; Rowe, Countryman, and Storey; wildfire",California; United States; Catchments; Decision trees; Floods; Forecasting; Machine learning; Rain; Risk assessment; Stream flow; Watersheds; Extreme weather events; Machine learning techniques; Polynomial functions; Recurrence intervals; Spatial and temporal variability; Streamflow prediction; Temporal and spatial; Watershed characteristics; analytical method; debris flow; flooding; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; watershed; wildfire; Fires

An efficient and fast response to wildfires is extremely important to reduce the damaging effect on humans and wildlife. This work introduces a methodology for designing an efficient machine learning system to detect wildfires using satellite imagery. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is optimized to reduce the required computational resources. Due to the limitations of images containing fire and seasonal variations, an image augmentation process is used to develop adequate training samples for the change in the forest’s visual features and the seasonal wind direction at the study area during the fire season. The selected CNN model (MobileNet) was trained to identify key features of various satellite images that contained fire or without fire. Then, the trained system is used to classify new satellite imagery and sort them into fire or no fire classes. A cloud-based development studio from Edge Impulse Inc. is used to create a NN model based on the transferred learning algorithm. The effects of four hyperparameters are assessed: input image resolution, depth multiplier, number of neurons in the dense layer, and dropout rate. The computational cost is evaluated based on the simulation of deploying the neural network model on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE device, including Flash usage, peak random access memory (RAM) usage, and network inference time. Results supported that the dropout rate only affects network prediction performance; however, the number of neurons in the dense layer had limited effects on performance and computational cost. Additionally, hyperparameters such as image size and network depth significantly impact the network model performance and the computational cost. According to the developed benchmark network analysis, the network model MobileNetV2, with 160 × 160 pixels image size and 50% depth reduction, shows a good classification accuracy and is about 70% computationally lighter than a full-depth network. Therefore, the proposed methodology can effectively design an ML application that instantly and efficiently analyses imagery from a spacecraft/weather balloon for the detection of wildfires without the need of an earth control centre. © 2023 by the authors.",convolutional neural network; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; wildfire,

In this research, we developed a novel hybrid machine-learning-technique algorithm to improve forest fire prediction based on random forest (RF), gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), and other machine learning models. The dataset we employed was satellite fire point data from 2010 to 2018 from the Chinese Department of Fire Prevention. The efficacy and performance of our methods were examined by validating the model fit and predictive capability. The results showed that the ensemble model LR (logistic regression)-RF-SVM-GBDT outperformed the single RFSVMGBDT model and the LR-RF-GBDT integrated framework, displaying higher accuracy and greater robustness. We believe that our newly developed hybrid machine-learning algorithm has the potential to improve the accuracy of predicting forest fire occurrences, thus enabling more efficient firefighting efforts and saving time and resources. © 2023 by the authors.",China; forest fires; hybrid model; machine learning,Accuracy; China; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Machinery; Trees; China; Adaptive boosting; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Forecasting; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Support vector machines; China; Ensemble models; Fire occurrences; Forest fires; Gradient boosting; Hybrid machine learning; Hybrid model; Machine-learning; Random forests; Support vectors machine; algorithm; forest fire; machine learning; mapping; modeling; satellite data; Decision trees

For modeling a geographical information system (GIS) database including 11 influencing factors and 262 fire locations from 2013 to 2018 is used for developing an integrated multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The cat swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm tunes the parameters of the MARS in order to generate accurate susceptibility maps. From the Pearson correlation results, it is observed that land use, temperature, and slope angle have strong correlation with the fire severity. The results demonstrate that the prediction capability of the MARS-CSO model outperforms model tree, reduced error pruning tree and MARS.

The degradation of the grassland ecosystem in South Africa is increasing alarmingly, and fire is regarded as one of the major culprits. Globally, anthropogenic climate changes have altered fire regimes in the grassland biome. Integrated fire-risk assessment systems provide an integral approach to fire prevention and mitigate the negative impacts of fire. However, fire risk-assessment is extremely challenging, owing to the myriad of factors that influence fire ignition and behaviour. Most fire danger systems do not consider fire causes; therefore, they are inadequate in validating the estimation of fire danger. Thus, fire danger assessment models should comprise the potential causes of fire. Understanding the key drivers of fire occurrence is key to the sustainable management of South Africa's grassland ecosystems. Therefore, this study explored six statistical and machine learning models-the frequency ratio (FR), weight of evidence (WoE), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to assess fire danger in an Afromontane grassland protected area (PA). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve results (ROC/AUC) revealed that DT showed the highest precision on model fit and success rate, while the WoE was used to record the highest prediction rate (AUC = 0.74). The WoE model showed that 53% of the study area is susceptible to fire. The land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation condition index (VCI) were the most influential factors. Corresponding analysis suggested that the fire regime of the study area is fuel-dominated. Thus, fire danger management strategies within the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) should include fuel management aiming at correctly weighing the effects of fuel in fire ignition and spread.",grassland fire; remote sensing; geographic information systems; machine learning; statistical methods; MaxEnt; Golden Gate Highlands National Park,FUEL MOISTURE-CONTENT; HUMAN WILDFIRE IGNITION; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; FOREST-FIRE; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; ZAGROS MOUNTAINS; YUNNAN PROVINCE; FREQUENCY RATIO

Therefore, this study introduces an enhanced approach using data from 2000 to 2019 in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of China, incorporating 18 driving factors. Bayesian optimization algorithms, i.e., the Gaussian Process (GP) and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) probabilistic proxy models, were used to optimize the hyperparameters for LightGBM, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), respectively. Finally, forest fire danger prediction models were constructed to draw forest fire danger maps, and the performance was compared between different models. In detail, the model's predictive performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, Balanced F Score (F1), and area under curve (AUC). The evaluation demonstrated that the TPE-LightGBM exhibited remarkable accuracy (AUC = 0.962). The forest fire danger map categorizes the study area into five danger levels.

In recent state-of-the-art solutions, only one or two techniques have been utilized for prediction. In this research, we investigate several methods for forest fire area prediction, including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Our aim is to identify the most effective and optimal method for predicting forest fires. After comparing our results with other artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques applied to the same dataset, we found that the LSTM approach outperforms the ARIMA and SVR predictors by more than 92%.

The ability to foresee the onset of such a natural disaster is, thus, of paramount importance in reducing this risk. There have been numerous proposed technologies and novel approaches for detecting and preventing forest fires. Integrating AI to automate fire prediction and detection is becoming increasingly common. To provide effective forest fire detection, people make use of several technological expansions, with the IoT for data collecting and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the forecast process.

This study looked at how climate change affects wildfire spread via prediction in the Guinean savannah (GSZ) and the forest-savannah mosaic (FSZ) in Ghana. Random forest regression was employed to attain this goal. As a result, the CCLM4-8-17 model outputs were employed and analyzed under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), since they better forecast the climate of the biological zones studied with less error (R2, RMSE, Bias, Spearman Correlation). As a result, there is a decrease in rainfall over the simulated period (2022–2100) in both zones (FSZ, GSZ), considering both scenarios (RCP4.5; RCP8.5), and an increase in temperature in FSZ (+0.08 °C for RCP4.5 and 0.1 °C for RCP8.5) and GZS (+0.04 °C for RCP4 and +0.09 °C for RCP8.5). Under RCP4 and RCP8 scenarios, the average number of active fires (HS) on their part shows that the average near future (2022–2060) will have more areas favourable to fire activities (active points) in both ecological zones: RCP4_GSZ_HS (316 n), RCP4_FSZ_HS (252 n), RCP8_GSZ_HS (333 n), RCP8_FSZ_HS (285 n), followed by the average far future (2061–2100) The average burnt area (BA) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.4 that average near future (2022–2060) will also contain a more burnt area in both ecological zones: RCP4_GSZ_BA (25290.96 ha), RCP4_FSZ_BA (20758.51 ha), RCP8_GSZ_BA (25766.66 ha), RCP8_FSZ_BA (20699.91 ha) followed by average for far future (2061–2100): RCP4_GSZ_BA (14849.20 ha), RCP4_FSZ_BA (11782.11 ha), RCP8_GSZ_BA (19,299.07 ha), RCP8_FSZ_BA (1072.01 ha). Thus, under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, tmax_RP4, SM, and ETA contribute more to fire activity and spread in the GSZ. However, in the FSZ, RH, tmax_RP4, and SM contribute more to fire activity and spread in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, with varying amounts. Because of the above, decision-makers and academics must take tangible steps to develop novel techniques to minimise the future impacts of fires. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Climate change; Forest-savanna mosaic zone; Ghana; Guinea-Savanna zone; Random forest; Wildfire,

This model achieves a 0.962 validation F2 score and a 0.932 F2 score on test data from Guyana and Suriname. Afterward, image segmentation is conducted on the Cirrus band using K-Means Clustering to simplify continuous pixel values into three discrete classes representing differing degrees of cirrus cloud contamination. Three additional Convolutional Neural Networks are trained to conduct a sensitivity analysis measuring the effect of simplified features on model accuracy and train time. The Experimental model trained on the segmented cirrus images provides a statistically significant decrease in train time compared to the Control model trained on raw cirrus images, without compromising binary accuracy.

We used 14 potentially influencing variables, four climatic factors, two anthropogenic, four topographic and four factors related to vegetation characteristics. The h-FIS method, together with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Randon Forest (RF) was implemented for the year 2018, 2019 and 2020, based on training (70%) and test (30%) data. The most important variables selected by the Boruta algorithm were considered. The prediction success of each map was determined using the ROC curve, AUC and global accuracy. The results obtained showed that the most important factors for predicting fires are land cover and use, air humidity, soil moisture, precipitation and elevation. In the three years analyzed, the h-FIS model demonstrated slightly higher performance compared to the SVM and RF models.

In recent years, the problem of increased levels of volatile organic compounds in drinking water distribution systems after wildfires has gained attention as it poses a significant health threat to communities in those wildfire -prone areas. No adequate deterministic process models to predict the risk of high levels of volatile organic compounds in drinking water distribution systems after wildfires are available at this point, leaving data -driven machine learning approaches as solutions for addressing this problem. Here we build on a preceding study and enhance the assessment of maximum contamination exceedance probability predictions by applying deep convolutional neural networks trained with water samples from communities affected by wildfires in California and Oregon. We used satellite surface reflectance imagery in combination with gridded information of topography, fuel load, meteorology, and infrastructure as model inputs. The results show that the ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks increases the accuracy of predictions of postwildfire water contamination by 4.1% compared to preceding models based on Bayesian regularized shallow feedforward networks, reaching an overall accuracy of 92% for the test dataset.

Traditional FF prediction approaches, reliant on meteorological data and human expertise, are often limited in accuracy and scalability. Deep Learning (DL) offers a promising solution for enhancing prediction capabilities. This systematic review evaluated various DL techniques for FF prediction, analyzing their methodologies, effectiveness, and challenges. Covering studies published between January 2017 and July 2024, 55 of 656 papers were selected for detailed analysis. The study revealed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are the most frequently used, with most datasets being publicly available.

Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Key meteorological features, such as Temperature, Humidity, and Wind speed, have been extensively studied using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the most commonly used satellite-derived features. However, integrating human activity data remains underexplored despite its potential to improve prediction accuracy significantly.

This research is devoted to the prediction of both spread and behavior of wildfires at a specific time and/or in specific regions for helping fire management agencies minimize the damages caused. The Brazilian Federal District, inserted in the Cerrado biome, is the focus of the analyses, due to its large number of fire occurrences and reduced number of studies conducted on the region. A dataset was compiled from Brazilian governmental open data for the prediction of the wildfire behavior and used for the training of several Machine Learning models that consider the fire point of ignition to predict the areas that will be impacted. It includes observations on climate features from 5 monitoring stations and satellite data on fires that occurred over the past two decades and was enriched with other topographic, hydrographic, and anthropogenic features, such as urbanization index, distance to rivers/roads, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). According to the results, AdaBoost model predicted the area affected by the wildfire with 91% accuracy, showing better performance than Random Forest (RF) 88%, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 86%, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 81%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",ADABoost; Artificial neural networks; Behavior; Climatic; Machine learning; Performance; Prediction; Random forest; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Wildfires,Adaptive boosting; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Random forests; Support vector machines; Behavior; Behavioural studies; Climatic; Forest fires; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Random forests; Support vectors machine; Wildfire; Vegetation

The research focuses on peatlands spanning 3.86 million ha, using key variables such as NDVI, surface temperature, and peat thickness derived from satellite data. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.732 and a classification accuracy of 70.3%, with medium-confidence hotspots demonstrating the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.707, F1-score: 0.804). However, the model struggled with low-confidence hotspots, reflecting challenges in distinguishing less prominent patterns in the data.

Understanding the complex interactions between wildfires and their environmental and anthropogenic factors is crucial for effective wildfire modeling and management. Despite significant advancements in wildfire modeling using machine learning (ML) methods, their limited explainability remains a barrier to utilizing them for in-depth wildfire analysis. This paper employs Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models along with the MODIS global fire atlas dataset (2004–2020) to study the influence of meteorological, topographic, vegetation, and human factors on wildfire occurrences in the mountainous region of Southwest China. It also utilizes Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a method within explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to demonstrate the influence of key controlling factors on the frequency of fire occurrences. The results indicate that wildfires in this region are primarily influenced by meteorological conditions, particularly sunshine duration, relative humidity (seasonal and daily), seasonal precipitation, and daily land surface temperature. Among local variables, altitude, proximity to roads, railways, residential areas, and population density are significant factors. All models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities with AUC values over 0.8 and prediction accuracies ranging from 76.0% to 95.0%. XGBoost outperforms LR and RF in predictive accuracy across all factor groups (climatic, local, and combinations thereof). The inclusion of topographic factors and human activities enhances model optimization to some extent. SHAP results reveal critical features that significantly influence wildfire occurrences, and the thresholds of positive or negative changes, highlighting that relative humidity, rain-free days, and land use land cover changes (LULC) are primary contributors to frequent wildfires in this region. Based on regional differences in wildfire drivers, a wildfire-risk zoning map for the mountainous region of Southwest China is created. Areas identified as high risk are predominantly located in the Northwestern and Southern parts of the study area, particularly in Yanyuan and Miyi, while areas assessed as low risk are mainly distributed in the Northeastern region. © 2024 by the authors.",driving factor; explainable artificial intelligence; extreme gradient boosting; machine learning; prediction accuracy; random forest; wildfire,Adaptive boosting; Deforestation; Logistic regression; Population dynamics; Driving factors; Explainable artificial intelligence; Extreme gradient boosting; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Mountainous regions; Prediction accuracy; Random forests; Southwest China; Wildfire; Risk assessment

The development of accurate strategies to prevent potential impacts and minimize the occurrence of disastrous events as much as possible requires modeling and forecasting severe conditions. In this study, we developed five new hybrid machine learning algorithms namely, Frequency Ratio-Multilayer Perceptron (FR-MLP), Frequency Ratio-Logistic Regression (FR-LR), Frequency Ratio-Classification and Regression Tree (FR-CART), Frequency Ratio-Support Vector Machine (FR-SVM), and Frequency Ratio-Random Forest (FR-RF), for mapping forest fire susceptibility in the north of Morocco. To this end, a total of 510 points of historic forest fires as the forest fire inventory map and 10 independent causal factors including elevation, slope, aspect, distance to roads, distance to residential areas, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature, and wind speed were used. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) was computed to assess the effectiveness of the models.

Wildfire susceptibility assessments have become essential for efficient disaster management and increasing resilience. In this study, we assessed the forest fire susceptibility in Istanbul Province and Thrace Region, Türkiye using a well-known machine learning technique, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Benefiting from freely available Earth Observation datasets such as Sentinel-2 images, Tree Cover Density from European Union (EU) European Environment Agency (EEA) Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, etc., and a forest inventory with ignition locations recorded over a period of eight years, we utilized a total of 16 independent and one dependent variables. The variables can be categorized as anthropogenic, topographic, vegetation, and hydrological factors. A ratio of 1:2 was preferred for the fire/non-fire location samples. The results show that the ANN exhibited high prediction performance with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) value and F-1 score of 0.94 and 0.80, respectively. Based on feature importance analyses, we found that a human-related factor, proximity to forest roads, was the most predictive input variable. The ANN model trained with openly available data (i.e., without forest database) also yielded a high F-1 score, but produced maps with fewer details. Our results confirm that data-driven machine learning methods are promising for regional forest fire susceptibility assessments and can be extended further for other regions by deriving similar parameters from freely available Earth Observation datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial neural network; Earth observation; Forest fire susceptibility assessment; Forest inventory; Spectral indices,Istanbul [Turkey]; Thrace; Turkey; artificial neural network; assessment method; disaster management; EOS; European Union; forest fire; machine learning; spectral analysis

This study examines the intensity and impacts of Chilgoza (Pinus gerardiana) Pine Forest fires by using advanced remote sensing techniques comprising Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) analyses based on Landsat 9 datasets. The study highlights the severe effect of these fires, resulting in noteworthy losses of livestock and private properties and widespread damage to 10,156.53 acres of the Chilgoza Pine Forest. A comprehensive variable correlation analysis is conducted to gain deeper insights into the influencing factors causing forest fires. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient was used to assess the association between burnt and unburnt areas and various independent factors. The analysis reveals compelling evidence of significant correlations with forest fire prevalence. This study found moderate negative (-0.532, p < 0.05) and positive (0.513, p < 0.05) correlations with elevation and Land Surface Temperature (LST), respectively, and a weak positive correlation (0.252, p < 0.05) with a Wind Speed (V). To predict forest fire susceptibility and better understand the contributing factors, three machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and logistic regression, are applied to assess variable importance scores. Among the considered factors, LST is the most critical variable, with consistently high variable importance scores (100 %, 96 %, and 59 %) across all three models. Wind Speed (V) also proved influential in all models, with variable importance scores of 78 %, 83 %, and 61 % for RF, XGBoost, and logistic regression, respectively. Moreover, elevation significantly influences the frequency of forest fires, as evidenced by variable importance scores ranging from 26 % to 100 %. Comparatively, the Random Forest model outperforms XGBoost and Logistic Regression in predicting forest fire vulnerability. During the training stage, the Random Forest (RF) model achieves an impressive classification accuracy of 99.1 %, followed by XGBoost with 94.5 % and Logistic Regression with 85.6 %. On evaluation with the validation dataset, the accuracies remain promising, with RF at 96.4 %, XGBoost at 91.1 %, and Logistic Regression at 84.6 %. Based on the Random Forest model, the identified high-risk sites offer valuable insights for proactive fire management and prevention strategies. This study provides a robust predictive model and a comprehensive understanding of forest fire severity and impacts.

In Zimbabwe, uncontrolled fires have been recurrent, yet a rigorous analysis of the key drivers is still lacking. Previous studies in Zimbabwe have predominantly focused on spatio-temporal dynamics of the occurrence of vegetation fire, leaving a gap in understanding the underlying drivers. Accurate prediction of fire occurrence and identification of the major drivers is imperative for effective fire management strategies. The study employs the Maxent model, a machine-learning approach, to analyze historical MODIS fire data alongside bioclimatic, topographic, anthropogenic, and vegetation variables, to assess the likelihood of fire occurrence in Zimbabwe. The research also aims to elucidate the major factors that influence fire occurrence within the region. The independent contributions of predictor variables to the model's goodness of fit are evaluated using a jackknife test, while model accuracy is assessed using the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Results indicate that elevation, precipitation seasonality, temperature annual range and human footprint emerge as the major factors influencing fire occurrence in Zimbabwe. The model demonstrates an acceptable accuracy, with an average AUC of 0.77. This study underscores the utility of the Maxent model in elucidating the contributions of various environmental factors to vegetation fire occurrence. Moreover, the ability of the model to predict the probability of fire occurrence offers valuable insights for fire managers, facilitating the assessment of the spatial vulnerability of vegetation to fire occurrence. Overall, this research contributes to an improved understanding of the drivers of vegetation fires in Zimbabwe and provides a practical tool for enhancing fire management efforts in the region and beyond.",Fire risk; Maxent; MODIS; Probability; Vulnerability; Zimbabwe,FOREST; PATTERNS

This risk has been assessed by various authors using many different methods and numerical models. Among these approaches, machine learning models have been successfully applied to determine the weights of criteria in risk assessment and risk prediction studies. In Istanbul, data have been collected for areas that are yet to be urbanized but are foreseen to be at risk using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies based on fires that occurred between 2000 and 2021. Here, the land use/land cover (LULC) characteristics of the region were examined, and machine learning techniques, including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting (LGB) models, were applied to classify the factors that affect fires. The RF model yielded the best results, with an accuracy of 0.70, an F1 score of 0.71, and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.76. In the RF model, the grouping between factors that initiate fires and factors that influence the spread of fires was distinct, and this distinction was also somewhat observable in the other two models. Risk scores were generated through the multiplication of the variable importance values of the factors and their respective layer values, culminating in a risk map for the region. The distribution of risk is in alignment with the number of fires that have previously occurred, and the risk in wildland–urban interface areas was found to be significantly higher than the risk in wildland areas alone. © 2023 by the authors.",fire risk; GIS; machine learning classification; rural–urban interface; wildland–urban interface,

Specifically, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire hotspots from 2001 to 2020 as training data. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC/AUC) for the prediction rate showed that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (ROC/AUC = 0.908) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (ROC/AUC = 0.903) show excellent performance.

Site-specific fuel models were created by measuring in the field several fuel parameters in representative natural fuel complexes, while the spatial extent of the fuel types was determined using a synergy of high-resolution imagery and high temporal information from medium spatial resolution imagery classified through object-based analysis and a machine learning classifier. The Minimum Travel Time (MTT) algorithm, as it is embedded in FlamMap software, was applied in order to evaluate Burn Probability (BP), Conditional Flame Length (CFL), Fire Size (FS), and Source-Sink Ratio (SSR). The results revealed low burn probabilities for the monasteries; however, nine out of the 20 monasteries have high fire potential in terms of fire intensity, which means that if an ignition occurs, an intense fire is expected.

Therefore, it is essential to identify and predict areas susceptible to fires, particularly in a country like China, where environmental and social conditions have undergone significant changes. In this study, we analyzed the spatial patterns of fires in distinct forest ecosystems across China. By incorporating RS and GIS technologies, and machine learning methodologies, we examined the factors influencing fires and developed a susceptibility model for different forest ecosystems. To generate fire susceptibility maps, we employed three machine learning models to establish connections between fire occurrences data and 17 predictor variables including climate, topography, vegetation, and human disturbances, namely artificial neural network, random forest, and the extreme gradient boosting models. The results showed that the fire points in different forest ecosystems showed a significant clustering distribution in space, and the driving factors of fire were different. We observed satisfactory performance across all the fire prediction models employed. Specially, extreme gradient boosting model exhibited superior performance with an AUC = 0.82–0.95; accuracy = 0.79–0.87; recall = 0.78–0.89; and F-Measure = 0.78–0.86.

This favored the occurrence of natural disasters and led to the 2020 Pantanal fire crisis. The purpose of this work was to map the burned area’s extent during this crisis in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal biome using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The classification of the burned areas was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) in the Google Earth Engine platform. Input variables in the algorithm were the percentiles 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 of monthly (July to December) mosaics of the shade fraction, NDVI, and NBR images derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images. The results showed an overall accuracy of 95.9% and an estimate of 44,998 km2 burned in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal, which resulted in severe ecosystem destruction and biodiversity loss in this biome. The burned area estimated in this work was higher than those estimated by the MCD64A1 (35,837 km2), Fire_cci (36,017 km2), GABAM (14,307 km2), and MapBiomas Fogo (23,372 km2) burned area products, which presented lower accuracies. These differences can be explained by the distinct datasets and methods used to obtain those estimates. The proposed approach based on Sentinel-2 images can potentially refine the burned area’s estimation at a regional scale and, consequently, improve the estimate of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning, where global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale. Our study brings to light the necessity of developing approaches that aim to improve data and theory about the impacts of fire in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal, in order to improve Earth systems models that forecast wetland–atmosphere interactions, and the role of these fires on current and future climate change over these regions. © 2023 by the authors.",burned area; NBR; NDVI; Pantanal; Sentinel-2; shade fraction; wetland,

Accordingly, this study focuses on developing a novel framework to assess forest fire risks and policy decisions on forest fire management in China. This framework integrated deep learning algorithms, geographic information, and multisource data. Compared to conventional approaches, our framework featured timesaving, easy implementation, and importantly, the use of deep learning that vividly integrates various factors from the environment and human activities. Information on 96,594 forest fire points from 2001 to 2019 was collected on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire hotspots from 2001 to 2019 from NASA's Fire Information Resource Management System. The information was classified into factors such as topography, climate, vegetation, and society. The prediction of forest fire risk was generated using a fully connected network model, and spatial autocorrelation used to analyze the spatial aggregation correlation of active fire hotspots in the whole area of China. The results show that high accuracy prediction of fire risks was achieved (accuracy 87.4%, positive predictive value 87.1%, sensitivity 88.9%, area under curve (AUC) 94.1%). Based on this, it was found that Chinese forest fire risk shows significant autocorrelation and agglomeration both in seasons and regions. For example, forest fire risk usually raises dramatically in spring and winter, and decreases in autumn and summer. Compared to the national average, Yunnan Province, Guangdong Province, and the Greater Hinggan Mountains region of Heilongjiang Province have higher fire risks. In contrast, a large region in central China has been recognized as having a long-term, low risk of forest fires. All forest risks in each region were recorded into the database and could contribute to the forest fire prevention. The successful assessment of forest fire risks in this study provides a comprehensive knowledge of fire risks in China over the last 20 years. Deep learning showed its advantage in integrating multiple factors in predicting forest fire risks. This technical framework is expected to be a feasible evaluation tool for the occurrence of forest fires in China. © 2022, Northeast Forestry University.",Deep learning; Forest fires; Management strategies; Risk zoning; Spatial autocorrelation,China; Guangdong; Heilongjiang; Yunnan; Autocorrelation; Decision making; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Information management; Learning algorithms; Losses; NASA; Risk assessment; Spatial variables measurement; Topography; Deep learning; Fire risks; Forest fires; Geographic information; Hotspots; Information data; Management strategies; Multisource data; Risk zoning; Spatial autocorrelations; autocorrelation; database; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; MODIS; prediction; risk assessment; Fires

These fires can have various causes, including human activities (such as agricultural burning, campfires, or discarded cigarettes) and natural factors (such as lightning). The present study presents a comprehensive and advanced methodology for assessing wildfire susceptibility by integrating diverse environmental variables and leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques across Gujarat State, India. The primary goal of the study is to utilize Google Earth Engine to compare locations in Gujarat, India, before and after forest fires. High-resolution satellite data were used to assess the amount and types of changes caused by forest fires. The present study meticulously analyzes various environmental variables, i.e., slope orientation, elevation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), drainage density, precipitation, and temperature to understand landscape characteristics and assess wildfire susceptibility. In addition, a sophisticated random forest regression model is used to predict land surface temperature based on a set of environmental parameters. The maps that result depict the geographical distribution of normalized burn ratio and difference normalized burn ratio and land surface temperature forecasts, providing valuable insights into spatial patterns and trends. The findings of this work show that an automated temporal analysis utilizing Google Earth Engine may be used successfully over a wide range of land cover types, providing critical data for future monitoring of such threats.

This research aims to identify and analyze the factors influencing forest fires in Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Papua during the rainy, dry and all-season conditions using machine learning techniques and create vulnerability prediction maps and categorize risk zones. Eight years (2015–2022) of forest fire data were combined with 15 forest fire susceptible factors that consider of human, environmental, meteorological, and land use/land cover conditioning factors. Random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models were used to train and validate the dataset through hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation for accuracy assessment. The XGB model was selected as the best performer based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score and was used to generate probability values. The evaluation showed that the accuracies and AUC values for the nine models were greater than 0.7, with AUC values ranging from 0.71 to 0.95, indicating good performance. Papua had the highest accuracy, with 90.5%, 91.6%, and 92.5% for all, rainy, and dry seasons, respectively. Population density, elevation, precipitation, soil moisture, NDMI, NDVI, distance from roads and settlements, land surface temperature and peatlands are the key contributing factors of forest fire occurrences. Vulnerability maps categorized into five risk zones, identifying high-risk areas that aligned with observed fire occurrences.

Consequently, there is a need for reliable and operational methods to monitor and map these disturbances for the development of suitable management strategies. While susceptibility assessment using machine learning methods has increased, most studies have focused on a single disturbance. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of the use of “Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)” in the literature. In this study, susceptibility assessment for multiple forest disturbances (fires, insect damage, and wind damage) was conducted using the PyCaret AutoML framework in the Izmir Regional Forest Directorate (RFD) in Turkey. The AutoML framework compared 14 machine learning algorithms and ranked the best models based on AUC (area under the curve) values. The extra tree classifier (ET) algorithm was selected for modeling the susceptibility of each disturbance due to its good performance (AUC values > 0.98). The study evaluated susceptibilities for both individual and multiple disturbances, creating a total of four susceptibility maps using fifteen driving factors in the assessment. According to the results, 82.5% of forested areas in the Izmir RFD are susceptible to multiple disturbances at high and very high levels. Additionally, a potential forest disturbances map was created, revealing that 15.6% of forested areas in the Izmir RFD may experience no damage from the disturbances considered, while 54.2% could face damage from all three disturbances.

Therefore, assessing regional wildfire susceptibility is crucial for the early prevention of wildfires and formulation of disaster management decisions. However, current research on wildfire susceptibility primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of models, while lacking in-depth study of the causes and mechanisms of wildfires, as well as the impact and losses they cause to the ecological environment and urban development. This situation not only increases the uncertainty of model predictions but also greatly reduces the specificity and practical significance of the models. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to analyze the spatial distribution of wildfire susceptibility and the effects of influencing factors, while assessing the risks of wildfire damage to the local ecological environment and urban development. In this study, we used wildfire information from the period 2013–2022 and data from 17 susceptibility factors in the city of Guilin as the basis, and utilized eight machine learning algorithms, namely logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), to assess wildfire susceptibility. By evaluating multiple indicators, we obtained the optimal model and used the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to explain the effects of the factors and the decision-making mechanism of the model. In addition, we collected and calculated corresponding indicators, with the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) representing ecological vulnerability and the Night-Time Lights Index (NTLI) representing urban development vulnerability. The coupling results of the two represent the comprehensive vulnerability of the ecology and city. Finally, by integrating wildfire susceptibility and vulnerability information, we assessed the risk of wildfire disasters in Guilin to reveal the overall distribution characteristics of wildfire disaster risk in Guilin. The results show that the AUC values of the eight models range from 0.809 to 0.927, with accuracy values ranging from 0.735 to 0.863 and RMSE values ranging from 0.327 to 0.423. Taking into account all the performance indicators, the XGBoost model provides the best results, with AUC, accuracy, and RMSE values of 0.927, 0.863, and 0.327, respectively. This indicates that the XGBoost model has the best predictive performance. The high-susceptibility areas are located in the central, northeast, south, and southwest regions of the study area. The factors of temperature, soil type, land use, distance to roads, and slope have the most significant impact on wildfire susceptibility. Based on the results of the ecological vulnerability and urban development vulnerability assessments, potential wildfire risk areas can be identified and assessed comprehensively and reasonably. The research results of this article not only can improve the specificity and practical significance of wildfire prediction models but also provide important reference for the prevention and response of wildfires. © 2023 by the authors.",ecological environment; machine learning; risk assessment; SHAP; urban development; wildfire susceptibility,Backpropagation; Decision trees; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Ecology; Fires; Geographic information systems; K-means clustering; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Urban growth; Ecological environments; Ecological vulnerability; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Multisource data; Risks assessments; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Urban development; Wildfire susceptibilities; Risk assessment

Our ML fire model substantially improved predictability of burned areas for both spatial and temporal dynamics compared with five commonly used machine learning models. More importantly, the model revealed strong time-lagged control from climate wetness on the burned areas. The model also predicted that, under a high-emission future climate scenario, the recently observed declines in burned area will reverse in South America in the near future due to climate changes.

Severe fires kill and consume large amounts of above- and belowground biomass and affect soils, resulting in long-lasting consequences for vegetation, aquatic ecosystem productivity and diversity, and other ecosystem properties. We analyzed the occurrence of, and trends in, satellite-derived burn severity across six ecoregions in the Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States from 1984 to 2006 using data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Using 1,024 fires from the Northwest (4,311,871 ha) and 497 fires from the Southwest (1,434,670 ha), we examined the relative influence of fine-scale topography and coarse-scale weather and climate on burn severity (the degree of change from before the fire to one year after) using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Together, topography, climate, and weather explained severe fire occurrence with classification accuracies ranging from 68% to 84%. Topographic variables were relatively more important predictors of severe fire occurrence than either climate or weather variables. Predictability of severe fire was consistently lower during years with widespread fires, suggesting that local control exerted by topography may be overwhelmed by regional climatic controls when fires burn in dry conditions. Annually, area burned severely was strongly correlated with area burned in all ecoregions (Pearson's correlation 0.86-0.97; p < 0.001), while the proportion of area burned severely was significantly correlated with area burned only in two ecoregions (p <= 0.037). During our short time series, only ecoregions in the Southwest showed evidence of a significant increase (p <= 0.036) in annual area burned and area burned severely, and annual proportion burned severely increased in just one of the three Southwest ecoregions. We suggest that predictive mapping of the potential for severe fire is possible, and will be improved with climate data at the scale of the topographic and Landsat-derived burn severity data. Although severity is a value-laden term implying negative ecosystem effects, we stress that severity can be objectively measured and recognize that high severity fire is an important ecological process within the historical range of variability in some ecosystems.",ecological change detection; fire ecology; Landsat TM; northwestern United States; Random Forests; relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR); remote sensing; southwestern United States; wildland fire,FIRE SEVERITY; KLAMATH MOUNTAINS; SIERRA-NEVADA; CLASSIFICATION; DISTURBANCE; CALIFORNIA; LANDSCAPE; VARIABILITY; REGRESSION; DROUGHT

Fire-driven loss of vegetation cover, for example, directly modifies the surface energy budget as a consequence of changing albedo, surface roughness, and partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes. Carbon dioxide and methane emitted by fires contribute to a positive atmospheric forcing, whereas emissions of carbonaceous aerosols may contribute to surface cooling. Process-based modeling of wildfires in Earth system land models is challenging due to limited understanding of human, climate, and ecosystem controls on fire counts, fire size, and burned area. Integration of mechanistic wildfire models within Earth system models requires careful parameter calibration, which is computationally expensive and subject to equifinality. To explore alternative approaches, we present a deep neural network (DNN) scheme that surrogates the process-based wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) interface. The DNN wildfire model accurately simulates observed burned area with over 90g% higher accuracy with a large reduction in parameterization time compared with the current process-based wildfire model. The surrogate wildfire model successfully captured the observed monthly regional burned area during validation period 2011 to 2015 (coefficient of determination, R2Combining double low line0.93). Since the DNN wildfire model has the same input and output requirements as the E3SM process-based wildfire model, our results demonstrate the applicability of machine learning for high accuracy and efficient large-scale land model development and predictions. © 2022 Qing Zhu et al.",,albedo; carbon dioxide; machine learning; methane; numerical model; wildfire

We integrated remotely sensed data, climate records, and landscape features to identify the causes of variability in the time-to-recover of canopy leaf area in southeast Australian eucalypt forests. Approximately 97% of all observed burns between 2001 and 2014 recovered to a pre-fire leaf area index (±0.25 sd) within six years. Time-to-recover was highly variable within individual wildfires (ranging between ≤1 and ≥5 years), across burn seasons (90% longer January to September), and year of fire (median time-to-recover varying four-fold across fire years). We used the logistic growth function to estimate the leaf area recovery rate, burn severity, and the long-term carrying capacity of leaf area. Time-to-recover was most correlated with the leaf area recovery rate. The leaf area recovery rate was largest in areas that experienced high burn severity, and smallest in areas of intermediate to low burn severity. The leaf area recovery rate was also strongly accelerated by anomalously high post-fire precipitation, and delayed by post-fire drought. Finally we developed a predictive machine-learning model of time-to-recover (R2: 0.68). Despite the exceptionally high burn severity of the 2019–2020 Australian megafires, we forecast the time-to-recover to be only 15% longer than the average of previous fire years. © 2024 The Authors.

Recently, Australia was hit hard by bushfires, the most devastating fires ever faced by the country. The economic damage reported was nearly one billion Australian dollars and an estimated three billion native animals were killed or adversely affected. Given the extent and intensity of this damage, researchers are seeking effective solutions to enable the prediction of fire before it starts to increase the time available for firefighters to protect lives and assets and prepare to mitigate the fires. This motivated us to investigate an approach to address this critical problem. In this article, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based approach that detects anomalies in spatiotemporal measurements of environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, etc.). In the proposed approach, an ML-based model learns the normal spatiotemporal behavior of the environmental data (collected over a period of one year). This is carried out during a one-time training phase. Then, during the detection phase, any spatiotemporal pattern in the real-time data (received from the field sensors) that is different than the normal pattern will be identified by the model as anomaly which indicates a possible bushfire situation. Following this, we propose a supplementary classification model based on Moran's I index to ensure that the detected anomalies are not due to either a sensor failure or a security attack (which are common in Internet of Things). We developed three different ML models for performance evaluation and comparison and used the Forest Fire data set to train them. The results of our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the early detection of fire symptoms. © 2014 IEEE.",Agriculture 4.0; Artificial intelligence; Australian bushfire; Edge Computing; Internet of Things (IoT),Climate change; Deforestation; Internet of things; Risk perception; Turing machines; Application scenario; Classification models; Effective solution; Environmental data; Environmental parameter; Rising temperatures; Spatiotemporal measurement; Spatiotemporal patterns; Fires

At each half-daily time step, fire pixels are clustered according to their spatial proximity, and are either appended to an existing active fire object or are assigned to a new object. This automatic system allows us to update the attributes of each fire event, delineate the fire perimeter, and identify the active fire front shortly after satellite data acquisition. Using this system, we mapped the history of California fires during 2012-2020.

Both areas are in the tropics which experience rainy and dry seasons annually. The long dry season such as in 2019 triggered forest and land fires in Borneo and Sumatra, causing haze disasters in the exposed areas. This indicates that climate variables play a role in burning forests and land in Borneo and Sumatra, but how climate affects the fires in both areas is still questionable. This study investigates the climate variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed in relation to the fire’s characteristics in Borneo and Sumatra. We use the Random Forest model to determine the characteristics of forest fires in Sumatra and Borneo based on the climate variables and carbon emission levels. According to the model, the fire event in Sumatra is slightly better predicted than in Borneo, indicating a climate-fire dependence is more prominent in Sumatra. Nevertheless, a maximum temperature variable is seemingly an important indicator for forest and land fire in both domains as it gives the largest contribution to the carbon emission. © 2023, Department of Informatics, UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, Indonesia.

Common empirical modelling methods for FOP include both model-based (statistical modelling) and algorithmic-based (machine learning) approaches. However, it was recently shown that many machine learning models in FOP literature are not suitable for fire management operations because of overprediction if not properly calibrated to output true probabilities. We present methods for properly calibrating statistical and machine learning models for fine-scale, spatially explicit daily FOP followed by a case-study comparison of human-caused FOP modelling in the Lac La Biche region of Alberta, Canada, using data from 1996 to 2016. Calibrated bagged classification trees, random forests, neural networks, logistic regression models and logistic generalised additive models (GAMs) are compared in order to assess the pros and cons of these approaches when properly calibrated. Results suggest that logistic GAMs can have similar performance to machine learning models for FOP.

Vegetation fires consists of forest fires, cropland fires, and other vegetation fires in this study. Currently, there is a limited amount of research on the long-term prediction of vegetation fires in Pakistan. The exact effect of every factor on the frequency of vegetation fires remains unclear when using standard analysis. This research utilized the high proficiency of machine learning algorithms to combine data from several sources, including the MODIS Global Fire Atlas dataset, topographic, climatic conditions, and different vegetation types acquired between 2001 and 2022. We tested many algorithms and ultimately chose four models for formal data processing. Their selection was based on their performance metrics, such as accuracy, computational efficiency, and preliminary test results. The model’s logistic regression, a random forest, a support vector machine, and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting were used to identify and select the nine key factors of forest and cropland fires and, in the case of other vegetation, seven key factors that cause a fire in Pakistan. The findings indicated that the vegetation fire prediction models achieved prediction accuracies ranging from 78.7 to 87.5% for forest fires, 70.4 to 84.0% for cropland fires, and 66.6 to 83.1% for other vegetation. Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) values ranged from 83.6 to 93.4% in forest fires, 72.6 to 90.6% in cropland fires, and 74.2 to 90.7% in other vegetation.

The models provided predictive insights into specific conditions and regional susceptibilities to fire occurrences, adding significant value beyond the initial MODIS detection data.

Traditional methods for detecting AFs rely on the statistical analysis of AF radiance and background features. However, these algorithms are resource-intensive to develop and exhibit limited adaptability, particularly in distinguishing AF from interference pixels. Deep learning (DL) technologies, which can extract deep features from images, offer a new solution for efficiently detecting AF. This article proposes an AF detection model based on convolutional neural networks, named DAFDM. By integrating multilayer features through an enhanced feature processing module, the model produces high-quality AF information, accurately detecting AF from the background. Given the presence of uncorrected false alarms in the training labels, it is challenging for DL models to distinguish interference pixels, we construct a Landsat-8 dataset encompassing various fire types and interference objects, with precise labels. Comparing several architectures, we find that only U-Net type models can discern the AF boundary pixels fully and accurately. The proposed method outperforms other AF detection algorithms, achieving IoU and F1-score of 87.28% and 93.21%, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that DAFDM possesses robust generalization capability in distinguishing interference pixels.

For this purpose, we looked at the spatiotemporal patterns and causes of wildfires between 2000 and 2023 using descriptive analysis. The data analysis included a discussion on density-based clustering as well as the distribution of the data across four seasons over a period of six years. Factors that could indicate the probability of a fire occurrence such as weather conditions, terrain characteristics, and fuel availability encompass details about the soil, economy, and vegetation. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features, and different machine learning (ML) techniques were implemented to obtain the best model for wildfire prediction. The majority of fires in the past six years have primarily occurred during the winter months in coastal locations. The occurrence of fires was accurately predicted by ML models such as random forest (RF), which outperformed competing models. Meanwhile, a CNN with 1D and 2D was used for more improvement in prediction by ML models. The accuracy increased from an 86.48 to 91.34 accuracy score by just using a CNN 1D.

This is extremely challenging due to the complexities of physical models and geographical features. Running physics-based simulations for large wildfire events in near real-time are computationally expensive, if not infeasible. In this work, we develop and test a novel data-model integration scheme for fire progression forecasting, that combines Reduced-order modelling, recurrent neural networks (Long-Short-Term Memory), data assimilation, and error covariance tuning. The Reduced-order modelling and the machine learning surrogate model ensure the efficiency of the proposed approach while the data assimilation enables the system to adjust the simulation with observations. We applied this algorithm to simulate and forecast three recent large wildfire events in California from 2017 to 2020. The deep-learning-based surrogate model runs around 1000 times faster than the Cellular Automata simulation which is used to generate training data-sets. The daily fire perimeters derived from satellite observation are used as observation data in Latent Assimilation to adjust the fire forecasting in near real-time. An error covariance tuning algorithm is also performed in the reduced space to estimate prior simulation and observation errors. The evolution of the averaged relative root mean square error (R-RMSE) shows that data assimilation and covariance tuning reduce the RMSE by about 50% and considerably improves the forecasting accuracy. As a first attempt at a reduced order wildfire spread forecasting, our exploratory work showed the potential of data-driven machine learning models to speed up fire forecasting for various applications. © 2022",Data assimilation; Deep learning; Fire spread; LSTM; Reduced-order modelling; Wildfire forecasting,Data reduction; Errors; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Data assimilation; Data driven; Deep learning; Fire spread; LSTM; Near-real time; Reduced order modelling; Reduced-order model; Surrogate modeling; Wildfire forecasting; Fires

In 2018, wildfires cost nearly 800 million dollars in economic loss and claimed more than 100 lives in California. Over 1.6 million acres of land has burned and caused large sums of environmental damage. Although, recently, researchers have introduced machine learning models and algorithms in predicting the wildfire risks, these results focused on special perspectives and were restricted to a limited number of data parameters. In this paper, we have proposed two data-driven machine learning approaches based on random forest models to predict the wildfire risk at areas near Monticello and Winters, California. This study demonstrated how the models were developed and applied with comprehensive data parameters such as powerlines, terrain, and vegetation in different perspectives that improved the spatial and temporal accuracy in predicting the risk of wildfire including fire ignition. The combined model uses the spatial and the temporal parameters as a single combined dataset to train and predict the fire risk, whereas the ensemble model was fed separate parameters that were later stacked to work as a single model. Our experiment shows that the combined model produced better results compared to the ensemble of random forest models on separate spatial data in terms of accuracy. The models were validated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, learning curves, and evaluation metrics such as: accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification report.

Historical weather and normalized difference vegetation index data sets of Australia for 2005-2021 were utilized. Two main unsupervised approaches were analyzed. The first used a deep autoencoder to obtain latent features, which were then fed into clustering models, isolation forest, local outlier factor and one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection.

Experts predict that wildfires will increase in the coming years mainly due to climate change. Early detection and prediction of fire spread can help reduce affected areas and improve firefighting. Numerous systems were developed to detect fire. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles were employed to tackle this problem due to their high flexibility, their low-cost, and their ability to cover wide areas during the day or night. However, they are still limited by challenging problems such as small fire size, background complexity, and image degradation. To deal with the aforementioned limitations, we adapted and optimized Deep Learning methods to detect wildfire at an early stage. A novel deep ensemble learning method, which combines EfficientNet-B5 and DenseNet-201 models, is proposed to identify and classify wildfire using aerial images. In addition, two vision transformers (TransUNet and TransFire) and a deep convolutional model (EfficientSeg) were employed to segment wildfire regions and determine the precise fire regions. The obtained results are promising and show the efficiency of using Deep Learning and vision transformers for wildfire classification and segmentation. The proposed model for wildfire classification obtained an accuracy of 85.12% and outperformed many state-of-the-art works. It proved its ability in classifying wildfire even small fire areas. The best semantic segmentation models achieved an F1-score of 99.9% for TransUNet architecture and 99.82% for TransFire architecture superior to recent published models. More specifically, we demonstrated the ability of these models to extract the finer details of wildfire using aerial images.

EO4WildFires integrates multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, SAR data from Sentinel-1, and meteorological data from NASA Power annotated with EFFIS data for forest fire detection and size estimation. These data cover 45 countries with a total of 31,730 wildfire events from 2018 to 2022. All of these various sources of data are archived into data cubes, with the intention of assessing wildfire severity by considering both current and historical forest conditions, utilizing a broad range of data including temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture. The experimental setup has been arranged to test the effectiveness of different deep learning architectures in predicting the size and shape of wildfire-burned areas. This study incorporates both image segmentation networks and visual transformers, employing a consistent experimental design across various models to ensure the comparability of the results. Adjustments were made to the training data, such as the exclusion of empty labels and very small events, to refine the focus on more significant wildfire events and potentially improve prediction accuracy. The models’ performance was evaluated using metrics like F1 score, IoU score, and Average Percentage Difference (aPD). These metrics offer a multi-faceted view of model performance, assessing aspects such as precision, sensitivity, and the accuracy of the burned area estimation. Through extensive testing the final model utilizing LinkNet and ResNet-34 as backbones, we obtained the following metric results on the test set: 0.86 F1 score, 0.75 IoU, and 70% aPD. These results were obtained when all of the available samples were used. When the empty labels were absent during the training and testing, the model increased its performance significantly: 0.87 F1 score, 0.77 IoU, and 44.8% aPD. This indicates that the number of samples, as well as their respectively size (area), tend to have an impact on the model’s robustness.

After that, they are combined by means of another expert system to determine the Global Risk Matrix that quantifies the risk of fire in each of the study regions and generates a visual representation of these results through a color map of the region itself. The proof of concept of the system has been carried out on a set of historical data from fires that occurred in the Montesinho Natural Park (Portugal), demonstrating its potential utility as a tool for the prevention and early detection of forest fires. The intelligent hybrid system designed has demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities in such a complex environment as forest fires, which are conditioned by multiple factors. Future improvements associated with data integration and the formalization of knowledge bases will make it possible to obtain a standard tool that could be used and validated in real time in different forest areas. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; design science research; expert systems; intelligent system; machine learning; wildfire,Area; Data; Deforestation; Detection; Development; Expert Systems; Forest Fires; Models; Data integration; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Deforestation; Expert systems; Fire hazards; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Deep learning; Design development; Design-science researches; Early fire; Fire detection; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Proof of concept; Risk matrix; Wildfire; conceptual framework; decision support system; design; detection method; forest fire; machine learning; Fires

Hence, reinforcing territorial risk management strategies against wildfires is essential. In this study, we built an early alert system (EAS) with two different Machine Learning (ML) techniques to calculate the meteorological conditions of two Colombian areas: (i) A 3D convolutional neural net capable of learning from satellite data and (ii) a convolutional network to bias-correct the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output. The results were used to quantify the daily Fire Weather Index and were coupled with the outcomes from a land cover analysis conducted through a Naïve-Bayes classifier to estimate the probability of wildfire occurrence. These results, combined with an assessment of global vulnerability in both locations, allow the construction of daily risk maps in both areas. On the other hand, a set of short-term preventive and corrective measures were suggested to public authorities to implement, after an early alert prediction of a possible future wildfire. Finally, Soil Management Practices are proposed to tackle the medium- and long-term causes of wildfire development, with the aim of reducing vulnerability and promoting soil protection. In conclusion, this paper creates an EAS for wildfires, based on novel ML techniques and risk maps. © 2022 by the authors.",bias correction; early alert system; machine learning; Naïve-Bayes classification; risk assessment; soil protection; susceptibility; wildfires,Bayes Theorem; Fires; Soil; Weather; Wildfires; Convolutional neural networks; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Machine learning; Maps; Multilayer neural networks; Risk management; Soils; Weather forecasting; Alert systems; Bias correction; Early alert system; Early alerts; Machine-learning; Naive Bayes classification; Risks assessments; Soil Protection; Susceptibility; Wildfire; Bayes theorem; fire; soil; weather; wildfire; Risk assessment

The traditional forest fire monitoring is time-consuming and inaccurate, but nighttime light remote sensing is enhancing the efficiency and speed of forest fire detection. Thus, this study focused on forest fire detection in Southwest China that was affected by fires in 2021 and 2022 using daily remote sensing nighttime light data from the black marble product VNP46A2 of the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite. Multiple features were developed based on the temporal features of day-level nighttime light radiances, which were divided into black pixels, stable light pixels, and forest fire pixels using the random forest classification model. To verify the accuracy, a confusion matrix was constructed to calculate the accuracy of the forest fire identification results by combining multisource data, and the results were compared with the results of different machine learning models and fire products. Moreover, the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires was analyzed using trend analysis and nearest-neighbor analysis. Results show that the overall accuracy of pixel classification was over 92% in both years, with forest fire pixels classified with user's accuracy exceeding 99%. The forest fires were mainly dispersed and concentrated around the stable light pixels 400-700 m, and the distribution in different regions showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. Compared with 2021, the distribution of forest fires decreased significantly in 2022. This study can support the future management and protection of forest resources and the prediction of fire disasters.

Particulate matter delays the GNSS signal, which affects the like precipitable water vapor (LPWV) derived by the GNSS non-hydrostatic delay. Most of the information of GNSS-derived LPWV is caused by water vapor, and a small part of the information is caused by particulate matter. A new method based on the difference (Delta PWV) between the PWV of virtual radiosonde stations network and GNSS-derived LPWV is proposed to detect the changes of particulate matter in the atmosphere during the 2020 California wildfires. There are few radiosonde stations in the experimental area and they are far away from the GNSS station. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network method to establish the virtual radiosonde network in the experimental area. The PWV derived by the fifth-generation European center for medium-range weather forecasts reanalysis model (PWVERA5) is used as the input data of machine learning. The PWV derived by radiosonde data (PWVRAD) is used as the training target data of machine learning. The Delta PWV is obtained based on PWV derived by the virtual radiosonde station network and GNSS in the experimental area. In order to further reduce the influence of noise and other factors on Delta PWV, this paper attempts to decompose Delta PWV time series by using the singular spectrum analysis method, and obtain its principal components, subsequently, analyzing the relationship between the principal components of Delta PWV with particulate matter. The results indicate that the accuracy of PWV predicted by the virtual radiosonde network is significantly better than the fifth-generation European center for the medium-range weather forecast reanalysis model, and the change trend of Delta PWV is basically consistent with the change law of particulate matter in which the value of Delta PWV in the case of fire is significantly higher than that before and after the fire. The mean of correlation coefficients between Delta PWV and PM10 at each GNSS station before, during and after wildfires are 0.068, 0.397 and 0.065, respectively, which show the evident enhancement of the correlation between Delta PWV and particulate matter during wildfires. It is concluded that because of the high sensitiveness of Delta PWV to the change of particulate matter, the GNSS technique can be used as an effective new approach to detect the change of particulate matter and, then, to detect wildfires effectively.",global navigation satellite system; 2020 California wildfires; virtual radiosonde stations network; multilayer perceptron neural network; PM10/PM2.5,ATMOSPHERIC WATER-VAPOR; GPS; PREDICTION; CHINA; PWV

It takes a lot of effort and long time to restore areas damaged by wildfires. Therefore, it is crucial to know the forest fire risk of a region to appropriately prepare and respond to such disastrous events. The purpose of this study is to develop an hourly forest fire risk index (HFRI) with 1 km spatial resolution using accessibility, fuel, time, and weather factors based on Catboost machine learning over South Korea. HFRI was calculated through an ensemble model that combined an integrated model using all factors and a meteorological model using weather factors only. To confirm the generalized performance of the proposed model, all forest fires that occurred from 2014 to 2019 were validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values through one-year-out cross-validation. The AUC value of HFRI ensemble model was 0.8434, higher than the meteorological model. HFRI was compared with the modified version of Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) used in the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating Systems and Daily Weather Index (DWI), South Korea's current forest fire risk index. When compared to DWI and the revised FFMC, HFRI enabled a more spatially detailed and seasonally stable forest fire risk simulation. In addition, the feature contribution to the forest fire risk prediction was analyzed through the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value of Catboost. The contributing variables were in the order of relative humidity, elevation, road density, and population density. It was confirmed that the accessibility factors played very important roles in forest fire risk modeling where most forest fires were caused by anthropogenic factors. The interaction between the variables was also examined.",machine learning; wildfires; susceptibility,NEURAL-NETWORK; SUSCEPTIBILITY; SYSTEM; MODELS; INDICATORS; PREDICTION; PROVINCE

Furthermore, the risk of forest fires is steadily increasing due to climate change. The most effective method for mitigating forest fire risk is proactive prevention before forest fires can occur by identifying high-risk areas based on land surface conditions. This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based forest fire diagnostic model designed for Republic of Korea, considering both satellite-derived land surface data and anthropogenic factors. For the remote sensing data, VTCI (Vegetation Temperature Condition Index) was used to reflect the land surface dryness. In addition, fire activity maps for buildings, roads and cropland were used to consider the influence of human activities. The forest fire diagnostic model yielded an accuracy of 0.89, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting forest fire risk. To validate the effectiveness of the model, 92 short-term forest fire risk forecast maps were generated from March to May 2023 with real-time data on forest fire occurrences collected for verification. The results showed that 73% of forest fires were accurately classified within high-risk zones, confirming the operational accuracy of the model. Through the forest fire diagnostic model, we have presented the impact relationships of meteorological, topographical, and environmental data, as well as the dryness index based on satellite images and anthropogenic factors, on forest fire occurrence.

To address this issue, we propose a novel salient object detection (SOD) network (DBINet) based on dual interactive convolution-transformer backbone for BAS in ORSIs. DBINet combines the benefits of CNN and transformer: CNN is good at extracting local spatial information, while transformer does well in modeling long-term dependencies. The core component of DBINet is three newly designed modules: dual-feature fusion module (DFM), convertor, and a novel decoder. Specifically, DFM is proposed to bridge two different backbones. Convertor is designed to fuse the multiscale coarse features from the main encoder and produce the fined feature for the decoder. The decoder has a multilevel feature aggregating process and a self-refining process, which restores the resolution and generates the prediction results.

Unprecedented fire events such as Australia's bushfires have alerted us to the fact that wildfire prediction is a critical scientific problem for fire management. Therefore, robust, long-lead models and dynamic predictions of wildfire are valuable for global fire prevention. However, despite decades of effort, the dynamic, effective, and accurate prediction of wildfire remains problematic. There is great uncertainty in predicting the future based on historical and existing spatiotemporal sequence data, but with advances in deep learning algorithms, solutions to prediction problems are being developed. Here, we present a dynamic prediction model of global burned area of wildfire employing a deep neural network (DNN) approach that produces effective wildfire forecasts based on historical time series predictors and satellite-based burned area products. A hybrid DNN that combines long short-term memory and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN2D-LSTM) was proposed, and CNN2D-LSTM model candidates with four different architectures were designed and compared to construct the optimal architecture for fire prediction. The proposed model was also shown to outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the fully connected long short-term memory (FcLSTM) approach using the refined index of agreement and evaluation metrics. We produced monthly global burned area spatiotemporal prediction maps and adequately reflected the seasonal peak in fire activity and highly fire-prone areas.

(9045036800)",Dynamic Savanna Burning Emission Factors Based On Satellite Data Using A Machine Learning Approach,2023,Earth System Dynamics,"Landscape fires, predominantly found in the frequently burning global savannas, are a substantial source of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The impact of these fires on atmospheric composition is partially determined by the chemical breakup of the constituents of the fuel into individual emitted chemical species, which is described by emission factors (EFs). These EFs are known to be dependent on, amongst other things, the type of fuel consumed, the moisture content of the fuel, and the meteorological conditions during the fire, indicating that savanna EFs are temporally and spatially dynamic. Global emission inventories, however, rely on static biome-averaged EFs, which makes them ill-suited for the estimation of regional biomass burning (BB) emissions and for capturing the effects of shifts in fire regimes. In this study we explore the main drivers of EF variability within the savanna biome and assess which geospatial proxies can be used to estimate dynamic EFs for global emission inventories. We made over 4500 bag measurements of CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O EFs using a UAS and also measured fuel parameters and fire-severity proxies during 129 individual fires. The measurements cover a variety of savanna ecosystems under different seasonal conditions sampled over the course of six fire seasons between 2017 and 2022. We complemented our own data with EFs from 85 fires with locations and dates provided in the literature. Based on the locations, dates, and times of the fires we retrieved a variety of fuel, weather, and fire-severity proxies (i.e. possible predictors) using globally available satellite and reanalysis data. We then trained random forest (RF) regressors to estimate EFs for CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O at a spatial resolution of 0.25 and a monthly time step. Using these modelled EFs, we calculated their spatiotemporal impact on BB emission estimates over the 2002-2016 period using the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 with small fires (GFED4s). We found that the most important field indicators for the EFs of CO2, CO, and CH4 were tree cover density, fuel moisture content, and the grass-to-litter ratio. The grass-to-litter ratio and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio were important indicators for N2O EFs. RF models using satellite observations performed well for the prediction of EF variability in the measured fires with out-of-sample correlation coefficients between 0.80 and 0.99, reducing the error between measured and modelled EFs by 60%-85% compared to using the static biome average. Using dynamic EFs, total global savanna emission estimates for 2002-2016 were 1.8% higher for CO, while CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were, respectively, 0.2%, 5%, and 18% lower compared to GFED4s. On a regional scale we found a spatial redistribution compared to GFED4s with higher CO, CH4, and N2O EFs in mesic regions and lower ones in xeric regions. Over the course of the fire season, drying resulted in gradually lower EFs of these species. Relatively speaking, the trend was stronger in open savannas than in woodlands, where towards the end of the fire season they increased again. Contrary to the minor impact on annual average savanna fire emissions, the model predicts localized deviations from static averages of the EFs of CO, CH4, and N2O exceeding 60% under seasonal conditions.  © 2023 Roland Vernooij et al.",,Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Machine learning; Moisture; Moisture determination; Satellites; Biomass burning emissions; Condition; Database versions; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Fire emissions; Fire severity; Global emissions; Global fire; Small fire; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; machine learning; pollution monitoring; savanna; Fires

Humans are responsible for the majority of fire ignitions. Physical and empirical models are used to estimate the future effects of fires on vegetation dynamics and the Earth’s system. However, there is no consensus on how human-caused fire ignitions should be represented in such models. This study aimed to identify which globally available predictors of human activity explain global fire ignitions as observed by satellites. We applied a random forest machine learning framework to state-of-the-art global climate, vegetation, and land cover datasets to establish a baseline against which influences of socioeconomic data (cropland fraction, gross domestic product (GDP), road density, livestock density, grazed lands) on fire ignition occurrence were evaluated. Our results showed that a baseline random forest without human predictors captured the spatial patterns of fire ignitions globally, with hotspots over Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. Adding single human predictors to the baseline model revealed that human variables vary in their effects on fire ignitions and that of the variables considered GDP is the most vital driver of fire ignitions. A combined model with all human predictors showed that the human variables improve the ignition predictions in most regions of the world, with some regions exhibiting worse predictions than the baseline model. We concluded that an ensemble of human predictors can add value to physical and empirical models. There are complex relationships between the variables, as evidenced by the improvement in bias in the combined model compared to the individual models. Furthermore, the variables tested have complex relationships that random forests may struggle to disentangle. Further work is required to detangle the complex regional relationships between these variables. These variables, e.g., population density, are well documented to have substantial effects on fire at local and regional scales; we determined that these variables may provide more insight at more continental scales. © 2023 by the authors.",fire; machine learning; socioeconomic drivers,

For short-term, the computational time of traditional simulators is too high to be tractable over large zones like a country or part of a country, especially for fire danger mapping. This issue is tackled by emulating the area of the burned surface returned after simulation of a fire igniting anywhere in Corsica island and spreading freely during one hour, with a wide range of possible environmental input conditions. A deep neural network with a hybrid architecture is used to account for two types of inputs: the spatial fields describing the surrounding landscape and the remaining scalar inputs. After training on a large simulation dataset, the network shows a satisfactory approximation error on a complementary test dataset with a MAPE of 32.8%. The convolutional part is pre-computed and the emulator is defined as the remaining part of the network, saving significant computational time. On a 32-core machine, the emulator has a speed-up factor of several thousands compared to the simulator and the overall relationship between its inputs and output is consistent with the expected physical behavior of fire spread. This reduction in computational time allows the computation of one-hour burned area map for the whole island of Corsica in less than a minute, opening new application in short-term fire danger mapping. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Corsica; Deep neural network; Fire growth prediction; Hybrid architecture; Mixed inputs; Numerical simulation,Computer Simulation; Deep Learning; Forecasting; France; Geographic Mapping; Time Factors; Wildfires; Fires; Large dataset; Mapping; Network architecture; Numerical models; Statistical tests; Computational time; Corsica; Fire danger; Fire growth prediction; Fire spread; Hybrid architectures; Mixed input; Neural-networks; Short term; Wildland fire; analytical error; Article; data processing; deep learning; deep neural network; geographic mapping; prediction; priority journal; simulation; two-dimensional imaging; wildfire; computer simulation; forecasting; France; procedures; time factor; Deep neural networks
"Seo, H; Kim, Y","Seo, Hocheol; Kim, Yeonjoo",Enhancing Alaskan Wildfire Prediction And Carbon Flux Estimation: A Two-stage Deep Learning Approach Within A Process-based Model,2024,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Wildfires in boreal forests release substantial amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. However, current land-surface models are limited in their representation of fire processes, including their ignition and spread. This study thus developed FireDL, a novel data-driven machine-learning model for the prediction of natural wildfires, and combined it with a land-surface model to better understand the impact of fire on carbon fluxes. FireDL has a two-stage deep learning structure that sequentially combines a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN). Preliminary random forest analysis identified fire duration as an important factor in predicting the burned area. Thus, in FireDL, the LSTM algorithm was employed to predict fire occurrence and duration, utilizing lightning, vegetation, and climate datasets. Subsequently, the ANN predicted the total burned area using the LTSM-derived fire duration predictions and climate datasets as input. FireDL produced a robust performance in predicting large fires (>10 000 ha), achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.72. The daily-scaled burned area predictions derived from FireDL were integrated into the Community Land Model version 5-Biogeochemistry (CLM5-BGC) to produce CLM5-BGC-FireDL. This integration considerably improved carbon emission estimations. Notably, the total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimated using CLM5-BGC-FireDL in 2019, the year with the highest recorded burned area during our study, was twice that estimated using the standard CLM5-BGC. Discrepancies in the NEE can significantly influence atmospheric CO(2 )levels, highlighting the importance of our fire prediction model in forecasting the burned area and carbon emissions. The use of FireDL with future climate scenarios is thus anticipated to yield valuable insights into ecosystem management and climate change",Alaskan wildfires; machine learning; land surface model; Cloud to ground lightning,EARTH SYSTEM; FIRE; DATASET; IMPACT

However, recent shifts in wildfire frequency, intensity, and seasonality pose unprecedented challenges for fire management in Alaska's remote and ecologically vulnerable regions. This study addresses the challenge of wildfire occurrence and behavior prediction in Alaska by developing a comprehensive framework that leverages satellite-based data, geospatial features, advanced optimization, and machine learning (ML). First, NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) dataset spanning +20 years is processed using a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to create refined wildfire datasets. A sequential Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed for cost-effective feature selection from 49 geospatial features, including remote sensing and reanalysis data. Histogram Gradient Boosting (HistGB) is then used for predictive modeling of wildfire occurrence, burnt area, and wildfire duration. This ensemble model's performance is benchmarked across four prediction horizons (same-day, +7 days, +30 days, +90 days) and against various conventional ML and deep learning techniques. Results highlight key factors influencing wildfire dynamics in Alaska and demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy (e.g., an average improvement of 72.62% in wildfire occurrence accuracy regardless of prediction horizon), offering valuable insights for risk assessment and resource allocation in wildfire management in Alaska. © 2024 The Authors",Alaska; Deep learning; Feature selection; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Permafrost lanscape; Wildfires,Alaska; United States; cluster analysis; genetic algorithm; machine learning; model validation; permafrost; remote sensing; resource allocation; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire

(57818820700); Valles, Damian (55546860600)",Enhancing Safety And Efficiency In Firefighting Operations Via Deep Learning And Temperature Forecasting Modeling In Autonomous Unit †,2023,Sensors,"Firefighters face numerous challenges when entering burning structures to rescue trapped victims, assess the conditions of a residential structure, and extinguish the fire as quickly as possible. These challenges include extreme temperatures, smoke, toxic gases, explosions, and falling objects, which can hinder their efficiency and pose risks to their safety. Accurate information and data about the burning site can help firefighters make informed decisions about their duties and determine when it is safe to enter and evacuate, reducing the likelihood of casualties. This research presents unsupervised deep learning (DL) to classify the danger levels at a burning site and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) prediction model to forecast temperature changes using the extrapolation of a random forest regressor. The DL classifier algorithms provide the chief firefighter with an awareness of the danger levels in the burning compartment. The prediction models forecast the rise in temperature from a height ranging from 0.6 m to 2.6 m and the changes in temperature over time at an altitude of 2.6 m. Predicting the temperature at this altitude is critical as the temperature increases faster with height, and elevated temperatures can weaken the building’s structural material. We also investigated a new classification method using an unsupervised DL autoencoder artificial neural network (AE-ANN). The prediction data analytical approach included using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with random forest regression implementation. The proposed AE-ANN model, with an accuracy score of 0.869, did not perform as well compared to previous work, with an accuracy of 0.989, at achieving high accuracy scores for the classification task using the same dataset. However, the random forest regressor and our ARIMA models are analyzed and evaluated in this work, while other research has not utilized this dataset, even though it is open-sourced. However, the ARIMA model demonstrated remarkable predictions of the trends of temperature changes in a burning site. The proposed research aims to classify fire sites into dangerous levels and predict temperature progression using deep learning and predictive modeling techniques. This research’s main contribution is using a random forest regressor and autoregressive integrated moving average models to predict temperature trends in burning sites. This research demonstrates the potential of using deep learning and predictive modeling to enhance firefighter safety and decision-making processes. © 2023 by the authors.",ANN; ARIMA; autoencoder; deep learning; fire; firefighting; random forest regression,Classification (of information); Decision making; Deep learning; Efficiency; Fire extinguishers; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Neural networks; Smoke; ANN; Auto encoders; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average; Deep learning; Firefighting; Moving average model; Moving averages; Random forest regression; Random forests; Fires

Machine learning (ML) and remote sensing technologies are extensively integrated and employed as powerful tools for WSM. However, the intricate nature of ML algorithms often leads to ‘black box’ systems, obscuring the decision-making process and significantly limiting stakeholders' ability to comprehend the basis of predictions. This opacity hinders efforts to enhance performance and risks exacerbating overfitting. This present study proposes an innovative WSM approach that incorporates qualitative and quantitative feature selection techniques within the Explainable AI (XAI) framework. The methodology aims to enhance the precision of WSM and provide insights into the factors contributing to model decisions, thereby increasing the interpretability of predictions and streamlining models to improve performance. To achieve this objective, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-Forward Stepwise Selection (FSS) method to demonstrate its efficacy in elucidating the qualitative and quantitative impacts of predictors on ML algorithm performance, accuracy, and interpretability designed for WSM. Utilizing post-fire imagery from Sentinel-2 (S2), we analyzed ten bands to generate 225 unique spectral indices utilizing five different calculations: normalized, algebraic sum, difference, ratio, and product forms. Combined with the original S2 bands, this resulted in 235 potential predictors for ML classifications. A random forest model was subsequently developed using these predictors and optimized through extensive hyperparameter tuning, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.917 and a Kappa statistic of 0.896. The most influential predictors were identified using SHAP values, with an FSS process narrowing them down to the 12 most critical for effective WSM, as evidenced by stabilized OA and Kappa values (0.904 and 0.881, respectively). Further validation using a ninefold spatial cross-validation technique demonstrated the method's consistent performance across different data partitions, with OA values ranging from 0.705 to 0.894 and Kappa values from 0.607 to 0.867. By providing a more accurate and comprehensible XAI-based method for WSM, this research contributes to the broader field of environmental monitoring and disaster response, underscoring the potential of integrated qualitative and quantitative analysis to enhance ML models' capabilities. © 2024 The Author(s)",Forward stepwise selection; Machine learning; Sentinel-2; SHAP; Wildfire severity mapping,accuracy assessment; algorithm; environmental monitoring; machine learning; mapping method; precision agriculture; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; stakeholder; wildfire

North-East India (NEI) experiences high incidences of forest fires, making it crucial to implement suitable management measures considering the driving forces influencing fire likelihood. This study aims to identify forest fire susceptibility zones in NEI by using five machine-learning modeling approaches, Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and an ensemble method. Forest fire data from the SNPP - VIIRS sensor (2018-2019) were rectified for spatial autocorrelation. Thirty-two responsive predictor variables related to topographic, climatic, biophysical, and anthropogenic factors were used as model inputs and multicollinearity analysis was performed to eliminate highly correlated predictors. Results indicate that the southern and southeastern regions of NEI, characterized by ample solar radiation, enhanced vegetation index, high human population density, and jhum cultivation, contribute significantly to higher susceptibility to forest fires. The Random Forest model performs best among the models employed, achieving an AUC value of 0.87. The ensemble susceptibility map, binarized based on AUC weighting, covers 29.54% of the total geographic area and 44.42% of the forested area of NEI. The vulnerability levels vary among states, with Mizoram showing the highest susceptibility at 89.27% and Sikkim exhibiting the lowest vulnerability at only 0.49% of their respective geographic areas. This map provides valuable insights for implementing effective forest fire management plans in the region.

Therefore, identifying and predicting the fire susceptible areas is crucial for managing protected area networks. In this study, we investigated the factors affecting forest fires and modelled the fire susceptibility in a human-dominated landscape in the central Western Ghats, India, by employing remote sensing, geographic information systems and machine learning techniques. We used six machine learning models (MLMs), including artificial neural network, random forest, generalized linear model, maximum entropy, multivariate adaptive regression splines, gradient boosting machine and the ensemble model, to relate the occurrence data of fires to 14 predictor variables categorized as climate, topography, vegetation, and anthropogenic disturbances to generate fire susceptibility maps. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC), true skill statistic (TSS) curves, accuracy and continuous Boyce index (CBI) were used to assess the model's accuracy. We found that all models achieved acceptable performance while validating the independent test data. However, ensemble model had the best overall performance with an AUC-ROC = 0.93; TSS = 0.72; ACCURACY = 0.89; and CBI = 0.95. The land-use and land-cover, and the distance to the agricultural fields and settlements were the key determinants of fire occurrences in the study area based on the ensemble model. The results showed that the landscape has a high to very high fire risk for about 26.5% of the total area. Forest fires have mostly occurred in the northeastern regions of the landscape, which are dominated by deciduous forests and plantations, whereas western regions are less susceptible to fires. Finally, we developed an ensemble-based fire susceptibility map with a resolution of 10 m that may be used as a tool for the prevention of forest fires. Further, it aids the relevant authorities in mitigating the disastrous effects and safeguarding the environment. The results demonstrated that ensemble-based MLMs can be employed effectively for fire prediction in other regions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Biomod2; blockCV; Ensemble model; Forest fire susceptibility modeling; Geospatial analysis; Tropical forest; Wildfires,Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Forecasts; Land Use; Neural Networks; India; Western Ghats; Biodiversity; Climate models; Conservation; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Land use; Machine learning; Neural networks; Topography; Tropics; Biomod2; Blockcv; Ensemble models; Forest fire susceptibility modeling; Forest fires; Geo-spatial analysis; Machine learning models; Tropical forest; Western ghats; Wildfire; biodiversity; forest fire; GIS; image resolution; landscape; machine learning; management; prediction; protected area; regression; risk; Fires

It consists in accurately predicting which areas of a territory are at higher risk of fire occurrence each next day, exploiting solely information obtained up until the previous day. The task’s requirements in spatial granularity and scale of predictions, as well as the extreme imbalance of the data distribution render it a rather demanding and difficult to accurately solve the problem. This is reflected in the current literature, where most existing works handle a simplified or limited version of the problem. Taking into account the above problem specificities, in this paper, we present a machine learning methodology that effectively (sensitivity > 90%, specificity > 65%) and efficiently performs next day fire prediction, in rather high spatial granularity and in the scale of a country. The key points of the proposed approach are summarized in: (a) the utilization of an extended set of fire driving factors (features), including topography-related, meteorology-related and Earth Observation (EO)-related features, as well as historical information of areas’ proneness to fire occurrence; (b) the deployment of a set of state-of-the-art classification algorithms that are properly tuned/optimized on the setting; (c) two alternative cross-validation schemes along with custom validation measures that allow the optimal and sound training of classification models, as well as the selection of different models, in relation to the desired trade-off between sensitivity (ratio of correctly identified fire areas) and specificity (ratio of correctly identified non-fire areas).

The use of machine learning (ML) methods to assess wildfire susceptibility can provide decision support for disaster prevention. However, most current ML-based wildfire susceptibility assessments overly focus on spatially evaluating the disaster threat, while ignoring the potential threats of wildfires to local ecosystems. This situation makes it difficult to determine seasonal variations in wildfire susceptibility and limits the value of assessment results. We present a framework to assess wildfire susceptibility and wildfire threats seasonally to local ecosystems. The ecosystem service value (ESV) was used as a proxy for the economic value of an ecosystem, the random forest algorithm was used to evaluate wildfire susceptibility, and the Daxinganling region, the largest forested area in China, was selected as the study area, and the dynamic equivalent coefficient factor method was used to calculate the ESV of each cell. Our main findings were as follows: (a) wildfire susceptibility exhibited obvious disparities in terms of spatial distribution across the four seasons; (b) each ecosystem in the study area faced a different magnitude of wildfire disturbance; and (c) the expected ESV loss (USD 10.8 billion) due to wildfires was much higher than the region's total GDP (USD 2 billion) in 2019. This study was repeatable, and all data required were obtained freely. The methodologies used can be applied directly to other regions.

Extreme fire conditions, such as drought, have been taking place simultaneously with many of these wildfires. In this study, the relationship was quantified between the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI) and wildfire burn area (BA) in California during the time of 1984-2018, and results indicate that the drought is a significant driver of wildfire BA in California. The methods of wavelet transform coherence, cross wavelet transform, and continuous wavelet transform were used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to analyse and establish the relationship between sc-PDSI and wildfire BA. This study concludes that there was a statistically significant relationship between wildfire BA and sc-PDSI in 6-8-, 5-6-, and 2-3-year bands during the study period, during which sc-PDSI was one of the main drivers for wildfire BA. In addition, machine learning was utilised in conjunction with the Quantile Regression Model (QRM) in order to quantify the relationship between sc-PDSI and wildfire BA in California. The findings provide a promising direction to improved prediction of wildfire BA which is significant in the aid of damage control of wildfires in California, potentially leading to less burned area, less economic damage, and fewer casualties. © 2022 The Author(s).

Zhejiang Province has the highest forest coverage rate in China, and forest fires are one of the main natural disasters impacting forest management in the region. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires based on the MODIS data from 2013 to 2023. The results showed that the annual incidence of forest fires in Zhejiang Province has shown an overall downward trend from 2013 to 2023, with forest fires occurring more frequently in winter and spring. By utilizing eight contributing factors of forest fire occurrence as variables, three models were constructed: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The RF and XGBoost models demonstrated high predictive ability, achieving accuracy rates of 0.85 and 0.92, f1-score of 0.84 and 0.92, and AUC values of 0.892 and 0.919, respectively. Further analysis using the RF and XGBoost models revealed that elevation and precipitation had the most significant effects on the occurrence of forest fires. Additionally, the predictions of forest fire risk generated by the RF and XGBoost models indicated that the incidence rate is high in the southern part of Zhejiang Province, particularly in the Wenzhou and Lishui areas, as well as in the southwest of the Hangzhou area and the north of the Quzhou area.

To lessen potential fire threats, it is helpful to recognize fire occurrence patterns and identify fire susceptibility in wildfire-prone regions. The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms is acknowledged as one of the most well-known methods for addressing non-linear issues like wildfire hazards. It has always been difficult to analyze these multivariate environmental disasters because modeling can be influenced by a variety of sources of uncertainty, including the quantity and quality of training procedures and input variables. Moreover, although ML techniques show promise in this field, they are unstable for a number of reasons, including the usage of irrelevant descriptor characteristics when developing the models. Explainable AI (XAI) can assist us in acquiring insights into these constraints and, consequently, modifying the modeling approach and training data necessary. In this research, we describe how a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) model can be utilized to interpret the results of a deep learning (DL) model that is developed for wildfire susceptibility prediction. Different contributing factors such as topographical, landcover/vegetation, and meteorological factors are fed into the model and various SHAP plots are used to identify which parameters are impacting the prediction model, their relative importance, and the reasoning behind specific decisions. The findings drawn from SHAP plots show the significant contributions made by factors such as humidity, wind speed, rainfall, elevation, slope, and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) to the suggested model's output for wildfire susceptibility mapping. We infer that developing an explainable model would aid in comprehending the model's decision to map wildfire susceptibility, pinpoint high-contributing components in the prediction model, and consequently control fire hazards effectively. © 2023 The Authors",Deep learning; GIS; Machine learning; SHAP; Wildfire susceptibility; XAI,Australia; Deep learning; Disasters; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Learning systems; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Community IS; Contributing factor; Deep learning; Environmental catastrophe; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Wildfire susceptibilities; XAI; artificial intelligence; factor analysis; GIS; machine learning; multivariate analysis; satellite data; topography; wildfire; air pollution; algal bloom; Article; artificial intelligence; decision making; deep learning; disaster; human; humidity; intelligence; machine learning; mathematical model; meteorological phenomena; nonhuman; particulate matter; prediction; predictive value; prevalence; quantitative structure activity relation; reasoning; receiver operating characteristic; systematic review; uncertainty; vegetation; wildfire; wind speed; Fires

Professionals forecast that forest fires would raise in the future because of climate change. Early prediction and identification of fire spread would enhance firefighting and reduce affected zones. Several systems have been advanced to detect fire. In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used for tackling this issue because of their ability, high flexibility, and their cheap price to cover vast areas during the nighttime or daytime. But still they are limited by difficulties like image degradation, small fire size, and background complexity. This study develops an automated Forest Fire Detection using Metaheuristics with Deep Learning (FFDMDL-DI) model. The presented FFDMDL-DI technique exploits the DL concepts on drone images to identify the occurrence of fire. To accomplish this, the FFDMDL-DI technique makes use of the Capsule Network (CapNet) model for feature extraction purposes with a biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm-based hyperparameter optimizer. For accurate forest fire detection, the FFDMDL-DI technique uses a unified deep neural network (DNN) model. Finally, the tree growth optimization (TGO) technique is utilized for the parameter adjustment of the DNN method. To depict the enhanced detection efficiency of the FFDMDL-DI approach, a series of simulations were performed. The outcomes reported improvements in the FFDMDL-DI method over other DL models. © 2023 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

Timely responses can significantly reduce the damages and consequences caused by their spread. Several critical issues in wildfire behavior analysis include fire occurrence forecasting, early detection, and spread prediction. In this study, we focus on wildfire occurrence forecasting, which is a valuable tool for facilitating earlier intervention. Conventional approaches primarily rely on the computation of fire indices based on weather conditions. However, solutions that utilize more comprehensive environmental data, remote sensing information, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may offer substantial advantages for rapid decision-making and extensive territory monitoring. The wide variety of spatial environmental parameters and the great diversity of geographical regions that influence wildfire occurrence complicate this task. Consequently, there is no unified approach for predicting wildfire occurrences using remote sensing data and AI techniques. The goal of this study is to explore the potential of predicting wildfire occurrences using various available environmental parameters - meteorological, geo-spatial, and anthropogenic - and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We developed a unified pipeline for data acquisition and subsequent ML-based algorithm development. The comprehensive analysis includes the following algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, Autoencoder, ConvLSTM, Attention Multilayer Perceptron, and RegNetX. In addition, we explore several metrics to assess the quality of developed models in case of highly imbalanced spatio-temporal data. To conduct the study, we collected a unique dataset covering several large regions in central Russia, incorporating more than 17,000 verified wildfire events over a period of 10 years. The findings underscore the necessity of developing individual ML models tailored to each region, taking into account the specific environmental features correlated with the probability of fire occurrence. The quality of the achieved models, as measured by F1-score, varies from 0.7 to 0.87 depending on the region, demonstrating the potential of integrating such algorithms into emergency response systems. © The Author(s) 2025.",Classification; Computer vision; Deep learning; Fire spreading; Image processing; Remote sensing,

In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to predict forest fire susceptibility in Nainital district. Our innovative methodology integrates several robust models — AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost and Random Forest — with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a meta-model in a stacking framework. This approach not only utilises the individual strengths of these models, but also improves the overall prediction performance and reliability. By using XAI techniques, in particular SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), we improve the interpretability of the models and provide insights into the decision-making processes. Our results show the effectiveness of the ensemble model in categorising forest fire susceptibility into different zones: very low, low, moderate, high and very high. In particular, the stacking ensemble and XGBoost models identified extensive areas of high and very high susceptibility, with precision, recall and F1 values underpinning their effectiveness. These models achieved ROC AUC values above 0.90, with XGBoost performing exceptionally well with an AUC of 0.94. The precision, recall and F1 values for these models are remarkably high. The inclusion of confidence intervals for the most important metrics in all models emphasises their robustness and reliability and supports their practical use in forest fire management. Through SHAP summary plots, we analyze the global variable importance, revealing annual rainfall and Evapotranspiration (ET) as key factors influencing susceptibility. Local analysis using LIME consistently highlights the importance of annual rainfall, ET, and distance from roads across all models.

R.; Qian, Y.",Extension Of Large Fire Emissions From Summer To Autumn And Its Drivers In The Western Us,2023,EARTHS FUTURE,"Burned areas in the western US have increased ten-fold since 1980s, which are attributable to multiple factors, including increasing heat, changing precipitation patterns, and extended drought. To better understand how these factors contribute to large fire emissions (gridded monthly fire emissions >95th percentile of all the fire emissions in the western US; 0.009 Gg/month), we build a machine learning model to predict fire emissions (PM2.5) over the western US at 0.25 degrees resolution, interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). From the predictor contributions derived from XAI, we conduct k-means clustering analysis to identify four clusters of predictor variables representing different drivers of large fire emissions. The four clusters feature the contributions of fuel load (Cluster 1) and different levels of dryness (Cluster 2-4), controlled by fuel moisture, drought condition, and fire-favorable large-scale meteorological patterns featuring high temperature, high pressure, and low relative humidity. In the past two decades, large fire emissions peak in summer. However, large fire emissions increased significantly in September and October in 2010-2020 relative to 2000-2009, extending the peak large fire emissions from summer to autumn. The larger enhancements of large fire emissions during autumn compared to summer are contributed by decreased fuel moisture, along with more frequent concurrent fire-favorable large-scale meteorological patterns and drought. These results highlight fuel drying as a common driver supported by multiple drivers, such as warmer temperature and more frequent synoptic patterns favorable for fires, in increasing the autumn risk of large fire emissions across the western US. Plain Language Summary Global warming has been raising temperature and drying out the western US. The increasingly warmer climate influences the seasonal water cycle over the western US and changes wildfire activity and its seasonality. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a set of useful tools for interpreting the predictions made by the machine learning (ML) models. Leveraging the power of XAI and a statistical clustering method, we built a ML model to predict the fire emissions over the western US and grouped the grids with large fire emissions by which predictors have larger contributions to the large fire emissions. We identified four groups of large fire emissions controlled by abundant fuel and extreme, moderate, and weak drying conditions, respectively. The drying conditions are contributed by multiple factors, including drought, local dryness, and fire-favorable large-scale meteorological patterns (high temperature, high pressure, and low relative humidity). Additionally, the large fire emission peak of the first three groups extends from summer to autumn. The increased fire emissions in autumn are caused by warmer temperature, decreased fuel moisture, along with concurrent fire-favorable large-scale meteorology and drought. These findings underscore the importance of drying in increasing the autumn risk of large fire emissions across the western US.",wildfires; machine learning,ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; WILDFIRE

Machine learning, due to its powerful non-linear modeling capabilities, has been widely applied in forest fire risk prediction research. However, existing studies often focus on the direct information provided by multiple environmental factor features when constructing the feature space, while overlooking the deeper information conveyed by feature cross-correlations. Additionally, fire risk prediction predominantly relies on single-model forecasting, exhibiting slightly insufficient generalization and stability in models. Model fusion algorithms (MFA) can combine the advantages of multiple models to compensate for this limitation. In this study, a machine learning framework, FC-StackGNB, combining feature crosses (FC) and model fusion, is proposed. This framework employs the FC method to analyze the temporal trends of various environmental factors influencing fire occurrence, constructing multiple seasonal cross features (SCFs) capable of effectively capturing the non-linear relationship between environmental factors and time. Moreover, the framework develops a Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) optimized stacking MFA to fully leverage the strengths of different ML algorithms. Results demonstrate that the introduction of SCFs effectively enhances the prediction performance of six machine learning models, with the mean values of five evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC_AUC) increasing by 1.58% to 6.30%. The fusion model constructed based on the StackGNB algorithm can effectively handle the multicollinearity issue of features, exhibiting significantly better prediction performance than single models, particularly in improving the Recall metric (increasing by around 3% and 5% compared to the top two ranked single models respectively), which signifies the model's ability to predict positive samples (i.e., high-risk fire areas). The proposed modeling framework effectively enhances the robustness and prediction performance of the models, offering new modeling insights for subsequent research.

Forest fires have increased significantly in recent years due to natural and artificial climatic factors. Therefore, accurate and early prediction of fires is essential. While significant advancements have been made in traditional and Deep Learning (DL) methods for fire detection, challenges remain in accurately pinpointing and recognizing fire regions, especially in diverse and large environments, to prevent damage effectively. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Federated Learning (FL)-based method called Indoor-Outdoor FireNet (IOFireNet) for detecting and localizing fire regions. The proposed method incorporates a Bilateral Filter (BF) to effectively preprocess fire images to reduce noise artifacts and enhance detection clarity. It employs Super Pixel-based Adaptive Clustering (SPAC) to precisely segment fire and non-fire regions. A global IOFireNet model is developed to aggregate parameters from local models, improving detection accuracy across varied environments, while MobileNet is used for efficient data processing, enabling predictions on fire spread, severity, and affected areas to support early warnings. The proposed FL-based IOFireNet attains an accuracy rate of 98.65% for fire detection and 97.14% of mean IoU for segmentation. The proposed SPAC model reaches a mean IoU of 4.06%, which is 2.45% better than the graph cut algorithm and CRF model.

Heterogeneity is a key challenge in federated settings. Recently, cross-technology communication (CTC) has emerged as a solution for Internet of Things (IoT) heterogeneity, enabling direct communication between different wireless devices without the need for hardware modifications or gateway intervention. For example, a sophisticated WiFi device can serve as a central coordinator for other heterogeneous devices, such as LoRa, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE, leading to more efficient and ubiquitous cross-network information exchange. However, heterogeneous wireless technologies present different data transmission rates and computing resources, making it difficult to achieve high accuracy in predictions due to large amounts of multidimensional data, communication delays, transmission latency, limited processing capacity, and data privacy concerns. In this work, we propose an FL framework based on CTC for heterogeneous IoT applications, called FLCTC.

A modification of the FWI method involves the utilization of the soil moisture deficit, in addition to the six subindices of the FWI system. In order to calculate the subindices values, weather data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service were used. Soil moisture deficit is calculated using Sentinel-1 radar satellite data on the water saturation degree of the soil surface layer and geospatial parameters from the 3D Soil Hydraulic Database of Europe. The application of the proposed methodology using the specified satellite, weather, and geospatial data makes it possible to assess fire danger on a continental scale with a spatial resolution of 250 m, 1 km, and a daily temporal resolution.

The forecast of fire danger is critically important to assist stakeholders to avoid and mitigate wildfire-induced hazards and losses to both human society and natural ecosystems. Currently, fire danger rating methods often focus on fire weather classification based on fixed thresholds, which has shortcomings in generalizability and robustness. Based on historical fire occurrence data and meteorological data of Northeastern China from 2004 to 2015, we proposed a forest fire danger rating classification and forecasting model by combining the advantages of the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) system and two machine learning models such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Random Forest (RF) model. The method is divided into two stages. The first stage is the LSTM-based FWI system indexes prediction. In the first stage, the future FWI system indexes are obtained through the LSTM-based prediction model, and the RMSE and MAE of the prediction results are calculated to verify the prediction performance of the model. The second stage is random forest-based fire danger rating prediction method. In the second stage, we use the random forest method to get the fire danger occurrence probability and present the fire danger rating classification scheme. Then we verify the reliability of the fire danger rating classification scheme by using the forest fire danger data in Qipan Mountain.

Despite numerous predictive studies in this field, wildfire management still had uncertainties. The machine learning technique was popular on this topic, but it portrayed gaps of non-generalisable and inaccuracy possibilities. This study intended to apply nonparametric predictive inference (NPI) with a parametric copula to predict the next wildfire location using the coordinate parameters. The NPI quantifies the uncertainties via imprecise probabilities, (P, P), while the copula integration considers the spatial correlation by modelling the dependence structure between the past coordinates in predicting the next location. Unlike other methods, the NPI generates a set of bounded probabilities that provide confidence in the prediction result. This paper applied the proposed method to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite dataset for Indonesia (2020). Several wildfire hotspots in Sumatra and Kalimantan archipelago were focused on this study. It was evaluated via the differences (d̅) within the (P, P) and showcased low values (d̅ < 0.001). The results show that NPI with parametric copula was highly accurate for both archipelagoes, highlighting its generalisability specifically for Indonesia. Each wildfire hotspot had a different optimal copula to predict the best future hotspot. Clayton and Gumbel copulae were the best to be integrated with NPI to predict the next wildfire location in Sumatra while Normal and Gumbel copulae for Kalimantan locations. In conclusion, the NPI is considered a reliable alternative for wildfire location prediction. © 2025, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Therefore, accurately and temporally estimating and mapping forest fire probability is necessary for preventing from destructive effects of forest fires. In this study, the forest fire occurrence in Southwestern Turkey was modeled and mapped with the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. We used past fire locations (from 2008 to 2018) with environmental variables such as fuel type, topography, meteorological parameters, and human activity for modeling and mapping, using data that could be obtained quickly and easily. The performances of fire occurrence models was quite satisfactory (AUC: range from 0.71 to 0.87) in terms of the model reliability. When the fire occurrence models were analyzed in detail, it was seen that the environmental variables with the highest gain when used alone were the maximum temperature, tree species composition, and distance to agricultural lands. To evaluate the models, we compared the fire locations between 2019 and 2020 with those on re-classified fire probability maps. Fire location from 2019-2020 fit substantially within the model fire occurrence predictions since many fire points in high or extreme fire probability categories has been observed.

The prediction of forest fires is vital for preventing their occurrence. Currently, there are fewer studies on the prediction of forest fires over longer time scales in China. This is due to the difficulty of forecasting forest fires. There are many factors that have an impact on the occurrence of forest fires. The specific contribution of each factor to the occurrence of forest fires is not clear when using conventional analyses. In this study, we leveraged the excellent performance of artificial intelligence algorithms in fusing data from multiple sources (e.g., fire hotspots, meteorological conditions, terrain, vegetation, and socioeconomic data collected from 2003 to 2016). We have tested several algorithms and, finally, four algorithms were selected for formal data processing. There were an artificial neural network, a radial basis function network, a support-vector machine, and a random forest to identify thirteen major drivers of forest fires in China. The models were evaluated using the five performance indicators of accuracy, precision, recall, f1 value, and area under the curve. We obtained the probability of forest fire occurrence in each province of China using the optimal model. Moreover, the spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas was mapped. The results showed that the prediction accuracies of the four forest fire prediction models were between 75.8% and 89.2%, and the area under the curve (AUC) values were between 0.840 and 0.960. The random forest model had the highest accuracy (89.2%) and AUC value (0.96). It was determined as the best performance model in this study. The prediction results indicate that the areas with high incidences of forest fires are mainly concentrated in north-eastern China (Heilongjiang Province and northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) and south-eastern China (including Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province). In areas at high risk of forest fire, management departments should improve forest fire prevention and control by establishing watch towers and using other monitoring equipment. This study helped in understanding the main drivers of forest fires in China over the period between 2003 and 2016, and determined the best performance model. The spatial distribution of high-to-low forest fire-prone areas maps were produced in order to depict the comprehensive views of China’s forest fire risks in each province. They were expected to form a scientific basis for helping the decision-making of China’s forest fire prevention authorities. © 2022 by the authors.",feature selection; forest fire driving factors; forest fire occurrence; machine learning; prediction model,Data handling; Decision trees; Deforestation; Feature extraction; Fire hazards; Fires; Radial basis function networks; Random forests; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Areas under the curves; Driving factors; Features selection; Fire occurrences; Forest fire driving factor; Forest fire occurrence; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Forecasting

From the perspective of the whole world, forest fires are a natural disaster with a great degree of hazard, and many countries have taken mountain fire prediction as an important measure for fire prevention and control, and have conducted corresponding research. In this study, a forest fire prediction model based on LSTNet is proposed to improve the accuracy of forest fire forecasts. The factors that influence forest fires are obtained through remote sensing satellites and GIS, and their correlation is estimated using Pearson correlation analysis and testing for multicollinearity. To account for the spatial aggregation of forest fires, the data set was constructed using oversampling methods and proportional stratified sampling, and the LSTNet forest fire prediction model was established based on eight influential factors. Finally, the predicted data were incorporated into the model and the predicted risk map of forest fires in Chongli, China was drawn. This paper uses metrics such as RMSE to compare with traditional machine learning methods, and the results show that the LSTNet model proposed in this paper has high accuracy (ACC 0.941).

However, current research studies on forest fire warning systems often focus on extensive geographic areas like states, counties, and provinces. This approach lacks the precision and detail needed for predicting fires in smaller regions. To address this gap, we propose a Transformer-based time series forecasting model aimed at improving the accuracy of forest fire predictions in smaller areas. Our study focuses on Quanzhou County, Guilin City, Guangxi Province, China. We utilized time series data from 2021 to 2022, along with remote sensing images and ArcGIS technology, to identify various factors influencing forest fires in this region. We established a time series dataset containing twelve influencing factors, each labeled with forest fire occurrences. By integrating these data with the Transformer model, we generated forest fire danger level prediction maps for Quanzhou County. Our model’s performance is compared with other deep learning methods using metrics such as RMSE, and the results reveal that the proposed Transformer model achieves higher accuracy (ACC = 0.903, MAPE = 0.259, MAE = 0.053, RMSE = 0.389).

The major threat raising in forest areas is a fire, in which the forest fire scenario is the most important cause to destroy many trees and animals within a few hours. The technologies such as deep learning, IoT and smart sensors provide a lead to design a smart forest fire prediction scheme to support nature to manage the ecosystem in the proper way. This paper is intended to design a forest fire prediction mechanism. Learning-based forest fire prediction scheme (LBFFPS) based on deep learning has been proposed for the prediction in the timely manner. This approach identifies the forest fire based on the sensor unit associated with the system with respect to the learning logics. A digital camera with 1020-megapixel has adapted for the surveillance. The sensor unit consists of two different and powerful sensors such as smoke identification sensor and the temperature and humidity monitoring sensor. Based on these two sensors the surrounding smoke presence, temperature and the humidity level have been identified and reported using the NodeMCU controller. In this application, internet of things (IoT) is associated, to provide a wireless communication alert ability. It collects and maintain the information regarding the forest provided by the sensor unit to the remote cloud server environment. The NodeMCU microcontroller has an inbuilt WiFi to acquire the internet signals and provides a constant bridge between the sensor unit and the server end for remote data maintenance.

A prediction model based on environmental condition, such as meteorological and vegetation indexes, is considered a promising tool to control forest fires. The construction of prediction models can be challenging due to (i) the requirement of selection of features most relevant to the prediction task, and (ii) heavily imbalanced data distribution where the number of large-scale forest fires is much less than that of small-scale ones. In this paper, we propose a forest fire prediction method that employs a sparse autoencoder-based deep neural network and a novel data balancing procedure. The method was tested on a forest fire dataset collected from the Montesinho Natural Park of Portugal. Compared to the best prediction results of other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method could predict large-scale forest fires more accurately, and reduces the mean absolute error by 3–19.3 and root mean squared error by 0.95–19.3. The proposed method can better benefit the management of wildland fires in advance and the prevention of serious fire accidents. It is expected that the prediction performance could be further improved if additional information and more data are available. © 2022 by the authors.",deep learning; deep neural network; fire prediction; imbalanced data; sparse autoencoder,Averages; Balancing; Control Systems; Data; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Portugal; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Auto encoders; Deep learning; Fire prediction; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Imbalanced data; Large-scale forest fire; Neural network method; Prediction modelling; Sparse autoencoder; artificial neural network; comparative study; environmental conditions; error analysis; fire behavior; fire management; forest fire; forest management; model test; performance assessment; prediction; Deep neural networks

Despite the limited existing research on forest fires in this area, the application of machine learning and neural network techniques presents an opportunity to enhance forest fire prevention and control efforts. Utilizing data of forest fire from the SC Forestry Commission for the year 2023, prediction models were developed incorporating various factors such as meteorology, terrain, vegetation, and infrastructure—key drivers of forest fires in SC. Feature importance analysis was employed to construct the final fire prediction model using different machine learning and neural network approaches including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Correlation coefficients analysis was employed to construct the final fire hazard map using a correlation test. The evaluation of predictive performance based on accuracy scores revealed that the DT model achieved the highest accuracy of 90.58%, surpassing other models. However, based on the kernel density map of the fire data from 2000 to 2023, the correlation test gave the better fire hazard map compared to any other machine learning or neural network approach that utilized feature importance. Nonetheless, all models achieved prediction accuracies exceeding 80%. This finding directed us to the approach based on the correlation coefficients rather than to those just based on feature importance. The overlap between fire locations and carbon hotspots provided the immediate need to mitigate the carbon loss due to fire in those locations. These results serve as a valuable resource for forest fire prediction in SC, demonstrating the efficacy of the correlation test, providing a theoretical foundation and data support for future forestry applications in the region, and showing the outperforming capability of this method compared to other approaches based on feature importance and the importance to prioritize areas to mitigate the climate change impact based upon fire prediction. © 2024 by the authors.",ArcGIS Pro; fire; Google Earth Engine; machine learning; neural network,

The Mediterranean region is traditionally the most at risk in Europe, but continental countries like Serbia have experienced significant economic and ecological losses due to forest fires. To prevent damage to forests and infrastructure, alongside other societal losses, it is necessary to create an effective protection system against fire, which minimizes the harmful effects. Forest fire probability mapping, as one of the basic tools in risk management, allows the allocation of resources for fire suppression, within a fire season, from zones with a lower risk to those under higher threat. Logistic regression (LR) has been used as a standard procedure in forest fire probability mapping, but in the last decade, machine learning methods such as fandom forest (RF) have become more frequent. The main goals in this study were to (i) determine the main explanatory variables for forest fire occurrence for both models, LR and RF, and (ii) map the probability of forest fire occurrence in Eastern Serbia based on LR and RF. The most important variable was drought code, followed by different anthropogenic features depending on the type of the model. The RF models demonstrated better overall predictive ability than LR models. The map produced may increase firefighting efficiency due to the early detection of forest fire and enable resources to be allocated in the eastern part of Serbia, which covers more than one-third of the country’s area. © 2020 by the authors.

Accurately assessing forest fire susceptibility is critical for effective environmental management. Supervised learning methods dominate this assessment, relying on a substantial dataset of forest fire occurrences for model training. However, obtaining precise forest fire location data remains challenging. To address this issue, semi-supervised learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging both a limited set of collected samples and unlabeled data containing environmental factors for training. Our study employed the transductive support vector machine (TSVM), a key semi-supervised learning method, to assess forest fire susceptibility in scenarios with limited samples. We conducted a comparative analysis, evaluating its performance against widely used supervised learning methods. The assessment area for forest fire susceptibility lies in Dayu County, Jiangxi Province, China, renowned for its vast forest cover and frequent fire incidents. We analyzed and generated maps depicting forest fire susceptibility, evaluating prediction accuracies for both supervised and semi-supervised learning methods across various small sample scenarios (e.g., 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 samples). Our findings indicate that TSVM exhibits superior prediction accuracy compared to supervised learning with limited samples, yielding more plausible forest fire susceptibility maps. For instance, at sample sizes of 4, 16, and 28, TSVM achieves prediction accuracies of approximately 0.8037, 0.9257, and 0.9583, respectively. In contrast, random forests, the top performers in supervised learning, demonstrate accuracies of approximately 0.7424, 0.8916, and 0.9431, respectively, for the same small sample sizes. Additionally, we discussed three key aspects: TSVM parameter configuration, the impact of unlabeled sample size, and performance within typical sample sizes.

We also proposed a dynamic factor extraction method based on dynamic time windows (DTW), constrained by daily or cumulative precipitation thresholds (Thcp), to obtain fine-grained forest CDS information by limiting the statistical time windows of dynamic factors. Our results demonstrated that the forest fire susceptibility modeling approach, incorporating the above two methods for sample sets and feature sets construction, significantly enhanced the prediction performance of three ML models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), underscoring its stability and robustness in improving model performance. The RF model outperformed the SVM and MLP models in terms of both performance improvement and prediction accuracy. The application of these two proposed methods improved the prediction accuracy of the RF model by more than 3% (FTW of at least 35 days) and 5% (Thcp of at least 40 mm), respectively. As Thcp increased, the performance enhancement became even more pronounced (accuracy can increase by over 8% when Thcp is 60 mm). The novel modeling approach, rooted in an understanding of the mechanisms underlying forest fires and adeptly capturing the forest spatially heterogeneous CDS information, can significantly improve the mapping accuracy. Moreover, coupled with the adaptive acquisition advantage of dynamic factors, this study is able to generate near real-time fire susceptibility maps, which hold greater practical value for aiding decision-makers in formulating effective prevention and management strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Cumulative dryness status; Dataset representativeness; Dynamic time windows; Forest fire susceptibility mapping; Machine learning; Performance improvement; Precipitation-constrained,Decision Making; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Mapping; China; Decision making; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mapping; Support vector machines; Cumulative dryness status; Dataset representativeness; Dynamic time; Dynamic time window; Forest fire susceptibility mapping; Forest fires; Machine-learning; Performance; Performance improvement; Precipitation-constrained; Susceptibility mapping; Time windows; extraction method; forest fire; forest management; heterogeneity; machine learning; support vector machine; Fires

To minimize these losses and reduce forest fires, modeling and predicting the occurrence of forest fires are meaningful because they can support forest fire prevention and management. In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has become an important state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, and its implementation has enriched many fields. Therefore, we proposed a spatial prediction model for forest fire susceptibility using a CNN. Past forest fire locations in Yunnan Province, China, from 2002 to 2010, and a set of 14 forest fire influencing factors were mapped using a geographic information system. Oversampling was applied to eliminate the class imbalance, and proportional stratified sampling was used to construct the training/validation sample libraries. A CNN architecture that is suitable for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility was designed and hyperparameters were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. Then, the test dataset was fed into the trained model to construct the spatial prediction map of forest fire susceptibility in Yunnan Province. Finally, the prediction performance of the proposed model was assessed using several statistical measures-Wilcoxon signed-rank test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC). The results confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed CNN model (AUC 0.86) than those of the random forests, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron neural network, and kernel logistic regression benchmark classifiers. The CNN has stronger fitting and classification abilities and can make full use of neighborhood information, which is a promising alternative for the spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility.

We used the open datasets of the Fire Luminosity Airborne-based Machine Learning Evaluation (FLAME) to train the YOLOv5 and its sub-versions, together with YOLOv3 and YOLOv4, under equal conditions. The results show that the YOLOv5n model can achieve a detection speed of 1.4 ms per frame, which is higher than that of all the other models. Furthermore, the algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 91.4%. Although this value is slightly lower than that of YOLOv5s, it achieves a trade-off between high accuracy and real-time.

In this paper, forest-fire-risk prediction was studied based on random forest (RF) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. The Heihe area of Heilongjiang Province is one of the key forest areas and forest-fire-prone areas in China. Based on daily historical forest-fire data from 1995 to 2015, daily meteorological data, topographic data and basic geographic information data, the main forest-fire driving factors were first analyzed by using RF importance characteristic evaluation and logistic stepwise regression. Then, the prediction models were established by using the two machine learning methods. Furthermore, the goodness of fit of the models was tested using the receiver operating characteristic test method. Finally, the fire-risk grades were divided by applying the kriging method. The results showed that 11 driving factors were significantly correlated with forest-fire occurrence, and days after the last rain, daily average relative humidity, daily maximum temperature, daily average water vapor pressure, daily minimum relative humidity and distance to settlement had a high correlation with the risk of forest-fire occurrence. The prediction accuracy of the two algorithms in regard to fire points was higher than that for nonfire points. The overall prediction accuracy and goodness of fit of the RF and BPNN algorithms were similar. The two methods were both suitable for forest-fire occurrence prediction.

An ensemble model was trained to predict landscape-scale fuels – such as the ’Scott and Burgan 40’ – using the as-received Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field survey plot data obtained from the USDA Forest Service. However, this basic approach yielded relatively poor results due to the inadequate amount of training data. Pseudo-labeled and fully synthetic datasets were developed using generative AI approaches to address the limitations of ground truth data availability. These synthetic datasets were used for augmenting the FIA data from California to enhance the robustness and coverage of model training. The use of an ensemble of methods – including deep learning neural networks, decision trees, and gradient boosting – offered a fuel mapping accuracy of nearly 80%. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated for regions of the 2021 Dixie and Caldor fires.

The underlying mechanisms present increased complexity, with the phenomenon itself being characterized by a significant degree of stochasticity. For the above reasons, machine learning models and neural networks are being implemented. In the current study, two types of neural networks are implemented, namely, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF). These neural networks utilize information from the Fire Weather Index (FWI), Fosberg Fire Weather Index (FFWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), aiming to predict ignitions in a region of Greece.

With 81% of its terrain forested, Gangwon-do is particularly susceptible to wildfires, as evidenced by the fact that seven out of the ten most extensive wildfires in Korea have occurred in this region, with significant ecological and economic implications. Here, we analyze 480 historical wildfire occurrences in Gangwon-do between 2003 and 2019 using 17 predictor variables of wildfire occurrence. We utilized three machine learning algorithms—random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine—to construct wildfire susceptibility prediction models and identify the best-performing model for Gangwon-do.

An in-depth understanding of the combined mechanisms of factors affecting the occurrence and spread of bushfires is needed to support the development of effective fire prevention plans and fire suppression measures and aid planning for geographic, ecological maintenance and urban emergency management. This study aimed to explore how bushfires, meteorological variability and other natural factors have interacted over the past 40 years in NSW Australia and how these influencing factors synergistically drive bushfires. The CSIRO’s Spark toolkit has been used to simulate bushfire burning spread over 24 h. The study uses NSW wildfire data from 1981–2020, combined with meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation, wind speed), vegetation data (NDVI data, vegetation type) and topography (slope, soil moisture) data to analyse the relationship between bushfires and influencing factors quantitatively. Machine learning-random forest regression was then used to determine the differences in the influence of bushfire factors on the incidence and burn scale of bushfires. Finally, the data on each influence factor was imported into Spark, and the results of the random forest model were used to set different influence weights in Spark to visualise the spread of bushfires burning over 24 h in four hotspot regions of bushfire in NSW. Wind speed, air temperature and soil moisture were found to have the most significant influence on the spread of bushfires, with the combined contribution of these three factors exceeding 60%, determining the spread of bushfires and the scale of burning. Precipitation and vegetation showed a greater influence on the annual frequency of bushfires. In addition, burn simulations show that wind direction influences the main direction of fire spread, whereas the shape of the flame front is mainly due to the influence of land classification. Besides, the simulation results from Spark could predict the temporal and spatial spread of fire, which is a potential decision aid for fireproofing agencies. The results of this study can inform how fire agencies can better understand fire occurrence mechanisms and use bushfire prediction and simulation techniques to support both their operational (short-term) and strategic (long-term) fire management responses and policies. © 2022 by the authors.

Global fire controls related to climate, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity are usually intertwined, and difficult to disentangle in a quantitative way. Here, we leveraged an ensemble of five machine learning (ML) models and multiple satellite-based observations to conduct global fire modeling for three fire metrics (burned area, fire number, and fire size), and quantified driving mechanisms underlying annual fire changes in a spatially resolved manner for the period 2003-2019. Ensemble learning is a meta-approach that combines multiple ML predictions to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance. We found that the optimized ensemble ML well reproduced annual dynamics of global burned area (R2 = 0.90, P < 0.001), total fire numbers (R2 = 0.86, P < 0.001), and averaged fire size (R2 = 0.70, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ensemble ML captured key spatial patterns of multi-year mean magnitudes, annual variabilities, anomalies, and trends for different fire metrics. Our ML-based fire attributions further highlighted the dominant role of enhanced anthropogenic activity in reducing global burned area (-1.9 Mha/yr, P < 0.01), followed by climate control (-1.3 Mha/yr, P < 0.01) and insignificant positive vegetation control (0.4 Mha/yr, P = 0.60). Spatially, climate dominated a much larger burned area (53.7%) than human (23.4%) or vegetation control (22.9%); however, the counteracting effects from regional wetting and drying trends weakened the net climate impacts on global burned area. The fire number and fire size exhibited similar spatial control patterns with burned area; globally, however, fire number tended to be more affected by climate while fire size more influenced by human activities. Overall, our study confirmed the feasibility and efficiency of ensemble ML in global fire modeling and subsequent control attributions, providing a better understanding of contemporary fire regimes and contributing to robust fire projections in a changing environment.",Contemporary fire dynamics; Global fire modeling; Fire attributions; Ensemble machine learning; Remote sensing; Climate -vegetation -human controls,BURNED AREA; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; WILDFIRE; CANADA

While existing computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale.

Traditional fire monitoring technologies like MODIS and VIIRS are often hindered by cloud cover and smoke. This study explores the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for fire monitoring in complex environments. By analyzing cumulative burned areas in southeastern Brazil, a new fire detection method combining GNSS-R with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is proposed to improve accuracy and response time. Results show high agreement between predicted and actual fire areas, with CNN outperforming Random Forest (RF) by 3.3% in prediction accuracy and achieving a 17.4% increase in model fitting. Error analysis indicates no systematic errors, with CNN exhibiting lower fire detection errors and better spatial alignment with actual conditions than RF, which tends to overestimate. This study provides a novel approach to fire detection using GNSS-R, with significant implications for fire prediction and management strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

(9337992700)",Guidelines For Effective Evaluation And Comparison Of Wildland Fire Occurrence Prediction Models,2021,International Journal of Wildland Fire,"Daily, fine-scale spatially explicit wildland fire occurrence prediction (FOP) models can inform fire management decisions. Many different data-driven modelling methods have been used for FOP. Several studies use multiple modelling methods to develop a set of candidate models for the same region, which are then compared against one another to choose a final model. We demonstrate that the methodologies often used for evaluating and comparing FOP models may lead to selecting a model that is ineffective for operational use. With an emphasis on spatially and temporally explicit FOP modelling for daily fire management operations, we outline and discuss several guidelines for evaluating and comparing data-driven FOP models, including choosing a testing dataset, choosing metrics for model evaluation, using temporal and spatial visualisations to assess model performance, recognising the variability in performance metrics, and collaborating with end users to ensure models meet their operational needs. A case study for human-caused FOP in a provincial fire control zone in the Lac La Biche region of Alberta, Canada, using data from 1996 to 2016 demonstrates the importance of following the suggested guidelines. Our findings indicate that many machine learning FOP models in the historical literature are not well suited for fire management operations.  © 2021 Journal Compilation ",area under curve (AUC); Brier score; logarithmic score; mean absolute error (MAE); model selection; precision-recall curve; receiver operating characteristic curve; visual diagnostics; wildfire occurrence,

It is vital to quantify and map the controlling drivers of wildfires for effective wildfire prediction and risk management. However, high-resolution mapping of wildfire drivers remains challenging. Here we established machine-learning (Random Forests) models using 23 climate and land surface variables as model inputs to reconstruct the spatial variability and seasonality of wildfire occurrence and extent in California. The importance of individual drivers was then quantified based on the Shapley value method. Thus, we provided spatially resolved maps of wildfire drivers at high resolutions up to 0.004° × 0.004°. The results indicated that precipitation and soil moisture are the major drivers dominating 37% of the total burnt area for large and extreme wildfires in summer and 63% in autumn, while elevation plays a major role for 15–58% of burnt areas in small wildfires in all seasons. Winds are also an important contributor to summer wildfires, accounting for 41% of large and extreme burnt areas.

Although machine learning (ML) models have yielded significant improvements in wildfire predictions, their limited interpretability has been an obstacle for their use in advancing understanding of wildfires. This study builds an ML model incorporating predictors of local meteorology, land-surface characteristics, and socioeconomic variables to predict monthly burned area at grid cells of 0.25° × 0.25° resolution over the contiguous United States. Besides these predictors, we construct and include predictors representing the large-scale circulation patterns conducive to wildfires, which largely improves the temporal correlations in several regions by 14%–44%. The Shapley additive explanation is introduced to quantify the contributions of the predictors to burned area. Results show a key role of longitude and latitude in delineating fire regimes with different temporal patterns of burned area. The model captures the physical relationship between burned area and vapor pressure deficit, relative humidity (RH), and energy release component (ERC), in agreement with the prior findings. Aggregating the contribution of predictor variables of all the grids by region, analyses show that ERC is the major contributor accounting for 14%–27% to large burned areas in the western US. In contrast, there is no leading factor contributing to large burned areas in the eastern US, although large-scale circulation patterns featuring less active upper-level ridge-trough and low RH two months earlier in winter contribute relatively more to large burned areas in spring in the southeastern US. © 2021.

To reduce the loss of semantic information and improve prediction accuracy, this paper combines dynamic threshold grayscale segmentation and residual network transfer learning. An effective training data extension strategy integrates the experimental data of a real fire platform and a forest-image-based fire database, where the experimental data of the real fire platform are shot based on different lighting and backgrounds. It has been proven that this is a good solution that can effectively solve the problem of training robust deep models relying on datasets with large diversity, which can improve the overall performance of the training model. Then, we introduce a network architecture based on dynamic threshold grayscale segmentation and residual net transfer learning, which reaches residual net level accuracy on image-based fire detection tasks with less computation. We train the model with a self-built image dataset, test it on a general fire image dataset, and evaluate it on a self-built fire video dataset. In numerous experiments, our method produced a training and testing accuracy of 98.26% and 99.90%, respectively, with corresponding losses of 0.036 and 0.04. The evaluation accuracy was 90% under the condition of a complex sample environment. Compared with other models, our method has advantages in accuracy, training loss, and cost time.

Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) combined with three meta-heuristic algorithms – Whale Optimization (WOA), Black Widow Optimization (BWO), and Butterfly Optimization (BOA) – were employed to map areas susceptible to wildfire. To generate a wildfire inventory, 1408 wildfire points were identified within the study area from 2004 to 2022. The four ML models (XGBoost, WOA-XGBoost, BWO-XGBoost, and BOA-XGBoost) were run using 14 wildfire-conditioning factors categorized into four main groups: topographical, meteorological, vegetation, and anthropogenic. Six performance metrics – sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), and the average precision (AP) of Precision–Recall Curves (PRCs) – were used to compare the predictive performance of the ML models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was also used to interpret the importance values of the 14 influential variables for the modeling of wildfire on Hawaiʻi Island using the four models. The results of the wildfire modeling indicated that all four models performed well, with the BWO-XGBoost model exhibiting a slightly higher prediction performance (AUC = 0.9269), followed by WOA-XGBoost (AUC = 0.9253), BOA-XGBoost (AUC = 0.9232), and XGBoost (AUC = 0.9164).

Most existing studies have primarily focused on climatic and topographical factors, while this research expands the scope by employing a synergistic approach that integrates geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and machine learning (ML) methodologies for identifying and assessing forest fire-prone areas in the STR and their vulnerability to climate change. To achieve this, the study employed a comprehensive dataset of forty-four influencing factors, including topographic, climate-hydrologic, forest health, vegetation indices, radar features, and anthropogenic interference, into ten ML models: neural net (nnet), AdaBag, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBTree), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), and its hybrid variants with differential evolution algorithm (RF-DEA), Gravitational Based Search (RF-GBS), Grey Wolf Optimization (RF-GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (RF-PSO), and genetic algorithm (RF-GA). The study revealed high FFS in both the northern and southern portions of the study area, with the nnet and RF-PSO models demonstrating susceptibility percentages of 12.44% and 12.89%, respectively. Conversely, very low FFS zones consistently displayed susceptibility scores of approximately 23.41% and 18.57% for the nnet and RF-PSO models. The robust mapping methodology was validated by impressive AUROC (>0.88) and kappa coefficient (>0.62) scores across all ML validation metrics. Future climate models (ssp245 and ssp585, 2022–2100) indicated high FFS zones along the northern and southern edges of the STR, with the central zone categorized from low to very low susceptibility. Boruta analysis identified actual evapotranspiration (AET) and relative humidity as key factors influencing forest fire ignition. SHAP evaluation reinforced the influence of these factors on FFS, while also highlighting the significant role of distance to road, distance to settlement, dNBR, slope, and humidity in prediction accuracy.

Process-based fire models quantify fire disturbance effects in stand-alone dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and their advances have incorporated both descriptions of natural processes and anthropogenic drivers. Nevertheless, these models show limited skill in modeling fire events at the global scale, due to stochastic characteristics of fire occurrence and behavior as well as the limits in empirical parameterizations in process-based models. As an alternative, machine learning has shown the capability of providing robust diagnostics of fire regimes. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based fire model (DL-fire) to estimate daily burnt area fraction at the global scale and couple it within JSBACH4, the land surface model used in the ICON-ESM. The stand-alone DL-fire model forced with meteorological, terrestrial and socio-economic variables is able to simulate global total burnt area, showing 0.8 of monthly correlation (rm) with GFED4 during the evaluation period (2011–2015). The performance remains similar with the hybrid modeling approach JSB4-DL-fire (rm = 0.79) outperforming the currently used uncalibrated standard fire model in JSBACH4 (rm = −0.07). We further quantify the importance of each predictor by applying layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Overall, land properties, such as fuel amount and water content in soil layers, stand out as the major factors determining burnt fraction in DL-fire, paralleled by meteorological conditions over tropical and high latitude regions. Our study demonstrates the potential of hybrid modeling in advancing fire prediction in ESMs by integrating deep learning approaches in physics-based dynamical models. © 2024 The Authors.

(57205763333)",Intelligent Deep Learning Enabled Wild Forest Fire Detection System,2023,Computer Systems Science and Engineering,"The latest advancements in computer vision and deep learning (DL) techniques pave the way to design novel tools for the detection and monitoring of forest fires. In this view, this paper presents an intelligent wild forest fire detection and alarming system using deep learning (IWFFDA-DL) model. The proposed IWFFDA-DL technique aims to identify forest fires at earlier stages through integrated sensors. The proposed IWFFDA-DL system includes an Integrated sensor system (ISS) combining an array of sensors that acts as the major input source that helps to forecast the fire. Then, the attention based convolution neural network with bidirectional long short term memory (ACNN-BLSTM) model is applied to examine and identify the existence of danger. For hyperparameter tuning of the ACNN-BLSTM model, the bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm is employed and thereby enhances the detection performance. Finally, when the fire is detected, the Global System for Mobiles (GSM) modem transmits messages to the authorities to take required actions. An extensive set of simulations were performed and the results are investigated interms of several aspects. The obtained results highlight the betterment of the IWFFDA-DL technique interms of various measures. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

However, most existing research on wildfire fields focuses primarily on wildfire identification and prediction, with limited attention given to the intelligent interpretation of detailed information, such as fire front within fire region. To address this gap, advance the analysis of fire front in UAV-captured visible images, and facilitate future calculations of fire behavior parameters, a new method is proposed for the intelligent segmentation and fire front interpretation of wildfire regions. This proposed method comprises three key steps: deep learning-based fire segmentation, boundary tracking of wildfire regions, and fire front interpretation. Specifically, the YOLOv7-tiny model is enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which integrates channel and spatial attention mechanisms to improve the model's focus on wildfire regions and boost the segmentation precision. Experimental results show that the proposed method improved detection and segmentation precision by 3.8 % and 3.6 %, respectively, compared to existing approaches, and achieved an average segmentation frame rate of 64.72 Hz, which is well above the 30 Hz threshold required for real-time fire segmentation. Furthermore, the method's effectiveness in boundary tracking and fire front interpreting was validated using an outdoor grassland fire fusion experiment's real fire image data. Additional tests were conducted in southern New South Wales, Australia, using data that confirmed the robustness of the method in accurately interpreting the fire front. The findings of this research have potential applications in dynamic data-driven forest fire spread modeling and fire digital twinning areas.

Ruby; Zhang, Yang",Interpreting Machine Learning Prediction Of Fire Emissions And Comparison With Firemip Process-based Models,2022,ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,"Annual burned areas in the United States have increased 2-fold during the past decades. With more large fires resulting in more emissions of fine particulate matter, an accurate prediction of fire emissions is critical for quantifying the impacts of fires on air quality, human health, and climate. This study aims to construct a machine learning (ML) model with game-theory interpretation to predict monthly fire emissions over the contiguous US (CONUS) and to understand the controlling factors of fire emissions. The optimized ML model is used to diagnose the process-based models in the Fire Modeling Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) to inform future development. Results show promising performance for the ML model, Community Land Model (CLM), and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator-Interactive Fire And Emission Algorithm For Natural Environments (JULES-INFERNO) in reproducing the spatial distributions, seasonality, and interannual variability of fire emissions over the CONUS. Regional analysis shows that only the ML model and CLM simulate the realistic interannual variability of fire emissions for most of the subregions (r > 0.95 for ML and r = 0.14 similar to 0.70 for CLM), except for Mediterranean California, where all the models perform poorly (r = 0.74 for ML and r < 0.30 for the FireMIP models). Regarding seasonality, most models capture the peak emission in July over the western US. However, all models except for the ML model fail to reproduce the bimodal peaks in July and October over Mediterranean California, which may be explained by the smaller wind speeds of the atmospheric forcing data during Santa Ana wind events and limitations in model parameterizations for capturing the effects of Santa Ana winds on fire activity. Furthermore, most models struggle to capture the spring peak in emissions in the southeastern US, probably due to underrepresentation of human effects and the influences of winter dryness on fires in the models. As for extreme events, both the ML model and CLM successfully reproduce the frequency map of extreme emission occurrence but overestimate the number of months with extremely large fire emissions. Comparing the fire PM2.5 emissions from the ML model with process-based fire models highlights their strengths and uncertainties for regional analysis and prediction and provides useful insights into future directions for model improvements.",,ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; BURNED AREA; INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; WILDFIRE ACTIVITY; EARTH SYSTEM; WESTERN US; IMPACTS; VEGETATION

Thus, fire smoke detection is important for early fire detection. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used to detect fire smoke in satellite imagery for fire detection. However, previous DL-based research only considered lower spatial resolution sensors (e.g., Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and only used the visible (i.e., red, green, blue (RGB)) bands. To contribute towards solutions for early fire smoke detection, we constructed a six-band imagery dataset from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) with a 30-metre spatial resolution. The dataset consists of 1836 images in three classes, namely “Smoke”, “Clear”, and “Other_aerosol”. To prepare for potential on-board-of-small-satellite detection, we designed a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model named “Variant Input Bands for Smoke Detection (VIB_SD)”, which achieved competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art model SAFA, with less than 2% of its number of parameters. We further investigated the impact of using additional Infra-Red (IR) bands on the accuracy of fire smoke detection with VIB_SD by training it with five different band combinations. The results demonstrated that adding the Near-Infra-Red (NIR) band improved prediction accuracy compared with only using the visible bands. Adding both Short-Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands can further improve the model performance compared with adding only one SWIR band. The case study showed that the model trained with multispectral bands could effectively detect fire smoke mixed with cloud over small geographic extents. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, the fire records in Shaanxi Province from 2010 to 2020 are utilized to construct a panel data model based on which two machine learning models including Random Forest (RF) model and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model are trained and used to analyze the relationship between socio-economic multivariate factors and fire incidence/fire risk level. The fire incidence is predicted based on regression analysis based on machine learning models, while the fire risk level is predicted based on the classification capability of machine learning models. The results show that both the optimal RF model and BPNN model perform well in the regression task, with R2 values to be 0.81 and 0.67, respectively; and can perform better in the prediction of fire risk level, with accuracy to be 91% and 91%, respectively. The results also reveal that socio-economic factors such as the population factors and economic factors could have the greatest importance for fire incidence prediction.

The detection of forest fire smoke can provide crucial information for the suppression of early fires. Previous detection models based on deep learning have been limited in detecting small smoke and smoke with smoke-like interference. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model for forest fire smoke detection that is suitable for UAVs. Firstly, a smoke dataset is created from a combination of forest smoke photos obtained through web crawling and enhanced photos generated by using the method of synthesizing smoke. Secondly, the GSELAN and GSSPPFCSPC modules are built based on Ghost Shuffle Convolution (GSConv), which efficiently reduces the number of parameters in the model and accelerates its convergence speed. Next, to address the problem of indistinguishable feature boundaries between clouds and smoke, we integrate coordinate attention (CA) into the YOLO feature extraction network to strengthen the extraction of smoke features and attenuate the background information. Additionally, we use Content-Aware Reassembly of FEatures (CARAFE) upsampling to expand the receptive field in the feature fusion network and fully exploit the semantic information. Finally, we adopt SCYLLA-Intersection over Union (SIoU) loss as a replacement for the original loss function in the prediction phase. This substitution leads to improved convergence efficiency and faster convergence. The experimental results demonstrate that the LMDFS model proposed for smoke detection achieves an accuracy of 80.2% with a 5.9% improvement compared to the baseline and a high number of Frames Per Second (FPS)—63.4. The model also reduces the parameter count by 14% and Giga FLoating-point Operations Per second (GFLOPs) by 6%. These results suggest that the proposed model can achieve a high accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources, making it a promising approach for practical deployment in applications for detecting smoke. © 2023 by the authors.",CARAFE; coordinate attention; deep learning; forest fire smoke detection; Ghost Shuffle Convolution; SIoU; Yolov7,Aircraft detection; Convolution; Deep learning; Deforestation; Extraction; Fires; Image enhancement; Semantics; Content-aware; Content-aware reassembly of feature; Coordinate attention; Deep learning; Forest fire smoke detection; Forest fire smokes; Ghost shuffle convolution; Reassembly; SCYLLA-intersection over union; Smoke detection; Yolov7; Smoke

Since this has a significant impact on various sectors of our life, recent works are concerned with identifying and predicting such extreme events from Earth observations. With respect to wildfire danger forecasting, previous deep learning approaches duplicate static variables along the time dimension and neglect the intrinsic differences between static and dynamic variables. Furthermore, most existing multibranch architectures lose the interconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. To address these issues, this article proposes a 2-D/3-D two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) with a location-aware adaptive normalization (LOAN) layer. Using LOAN as a building block, we can modulate the dynamic features conditional on their geographical locations. Thus, our approach considers feature properties as a unified yet compound 2-D/3-D model. Besides, we propose using the sinusoidal-based encoding of the day of the year to provide the model with explicit temporal information about the target day within the year. Our experimental results show a better performance of our approach than other baselines on the challenging FireCube dataset. The results show that location-aware adaptive feature normalization is a promising technique to learn the relation between dynamic variables and their geographic locations, which is highly relevant for areas where remote sensing data build the basis for analysis.

(10641234700)",Machine Learning Algorithms Applied To Wildfire Data In California's Central Valley,2024,"Trees, Forests and People","This study focuses on using Machine Learning methods to predict wildfires within California's Central Valley. The specific areas within the Central Valley were Yosemite Valley, Sequoias, and Kings Canyon since these areas can be considered wildfire hotspots. This topic is relevant since California has seen an increase in wildfires with an increase in annual forest burned areas to +172 % from 1996 to 2021 (ABC 2024). The algorithms selected were based on previous research that conducted similar studies. From this research it is hypothesized that the best performing algorithm for predicting wildfires would be Random Forest. The novelty in this study stems from focusing on the specific areas mentioned above, which is where many wildfires have occurred throughout the years. The overall goal is to determine the best machine learning algorithm to predict wildfires in the Central Valley and take the results to improve upon wildfire prevention within these regions. The methods implemented included Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Networks. The dataset was gathered from the following satellite data which include MERRA-2 and USGS Landsat 8 along with fire history from 2012 to 2023 within these regions. Utilizing the dataset in the following two variations were a random split and a chronological split of training and testing sets. The best-performing algorithm using this dataset was Decision Trees at 550 maximum splits with an F1-Score of 0.689. The F1-Score ranges between 0 and 1 with a score of 0.7 or higher being deemed a good model to be used for predictions. The conclusion that could be determined from this result is that the randomized data has better predicting power over a chronologically split dataset. This can be seen in the confusion matrices for the chronological split dataset having zero true positive values in all the methods except for Naïve Bayes. Overall, the results show that Decision trees with a larger maximum split in the leaf nodes result in a more accurate prediction of whether a fire will occur within the given regions. The conclusion that can be made from this result is that Decision Trees can be a useful tool in predicting wildfires in California's Central Valley. The applications of this research would be the ability to use the information gained in this study to aid in optimizing resources in wildfire prevention within these areas. © 2024 The Authors",Decision trees; Machine learning; Naïve Bayes; Neural networks; Random forest; Wildfire prediction,California; United States; algorithm; artificial neural network; Landsat; machine learning; optimization; prediction; satellite data; wildfire

Classical wildfire spread models have relied on mathematical and empirical approaches, which have trouble capturing the complexity of fire dynamics and suffer from poor flexibility and static assumptions. The emergence of machine learning (ML) and, more specifically, deep learning (DL) has introduced new techniques that significantly enhance prediction accuracy. ML models, such as support vector machines and ensemble models, use tabular data points to identify patterns and predict fire behavior. However, these models often struggle with the dynamic nature of wildfires. In contrast, DL approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and convolutional recurrent networks (CRNs), excel at handling the spatiotemporal complexities of wildfire data. CNNs are particularly effective at analyzing spatial data from satellite imagery, while CRNs are suited for both spatial and sequential data, making them highly performant in predicting fire behavior. This paper presents a systematic review of recent ML and DL techniques developed for wildfire spread prediction, detailing the commonly used datasets, the improvements achieved, and the limitations of current methods. It also outlines future research directions to address these challenges, emphasizing the potential for DL to play an important role in wildfire management and mitigation strategies.",fire spread; fire modeling; wildfire; machine learning; deep learning,FIRE; MODEL

The complex interactions among fuels, topography, and meteorological factors, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind, govern wildfire ignition and spread. This research presents a framework that integrates satellite remote sensing and numerical weather prediction model data to refine estimations of final wildfire sizes. A key strength of our approach is the use of comprehensive geospatial datasets from the IBM PAIRS platform, which provides a robust foundation for our predictions. We implement machine learning techniques through the AutoGluon automated machine learning toolkit to determine the optimal model for burned area prediction. AutoGluon automates the process of feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, evaluating a diverse range of algorithms, including neural networks, gradient boosting, and ensemble methods, to identify the most effective predictor for wildfire area estimation. The system features an intuitive interface developed in Gradio, which allows the incorporation of key input parameters, such as vegetation indices and weather variables, to customize wildfire projections. Interactive Plotly visualizations categorize the predicted fire severity levels across regions. This study demonstrates the value of synergizing Earth observations from spaceborne instruments and forecast data from numerical models to strengthen real-time wildfire monitoring and postfire impact assessment capabilities for improved disaster management. We optimize an ensemble model by comparing various algorithms to minimize the root mean squared error between the predicted and actual burned areas, achieving improved predictive performance over any individual model. The final metric reveals that our optimized WeightedEnsemble model achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.564 km2 on the test data, indicating an average deviation of approximately 1.2 km2 in the predictions. © 2025, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

One common representation of the fire progression is through the fire arrival time, which defines the time that the fire arrives at a given location. Estimating the fire arrival time is critical for initializing the fire location within coupled fire-atmosphere models. We present a new method that utilizes machine learning to estimate the fire arrival time from satellite data in the form of burning/not burning/no data rasters. The proposed method, based on a support vector machine (SVM), is tested on the 10 largest California wildfires of the 2020 fire season, and evaluated using independent observed data from airborne infrared (IR) fire perimeters. The SVM method results indicate a good agreement with airborne fire observations in terms of the fire growth and a spatial representation of the fire extent. A 12% burned area absolute percentage error, a 5% total burned area mean percentage error, a 0.21 False Alarm Ratio average, a 0.86 Probability of Detection average, and a 0.82 Sørensen’s coefficient average suggest that this method can be used to monitor wildfires in near-real-time and provide accurate fire arrival times for improving fire modeling even in the absence of IR fire perimeters. © 2021 by the authors.

Predicting the occurrence of forest fires can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in China’s forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation, topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel moisture content. In this study, the traditional driving factors of forest fire such as satellite hotspots, vegetation, meteorology, topography and human activities from 2004 to 2021 were introduced along with forest fuel factors (vegetation canopy water content and evapotranspiration from the top of the vegetation canopy), and a database of factors for predicting forest fire occurrence was constructed. And a forest fire occurrence prediction model was built using machine learning methods such as the Random Forest model (RF), the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model (GBDT) and the Adaptive Augmentation Model (AdaBoost). The accuracy of the models was verified using Area Under Curve (AUC) and four other metrics. The RF model with an AUC value of 0.981 was more accurate than all other models in predicting the probability of forest fire occurrence, followed by the GBDT (AUC = 0.978) and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.891) models. The RF model, which has the best accuracy, was selected to predict the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha in 2022 and combined with the Inverse Distance Weight Interpolation method to plot the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha. We found that the monthly spatial and temporal distribution of forest fire probability in Changsha varied significantly, with March, April, May, September, October, November and December being the months with higher forest fire probability. The highest probability of forest fires occurred in the central and northern regions. In this study, the core drivers affecting the occurrence of forest fires in Changsha City were found to be vegetation canopy evapotranspiration and vegetation canopy water content. The RF model was identified as a more suitable forest fire occurrence probability prediction model for Changsha City. Meanwhile, this study found that vegetation characteristics and combustible factors have more influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City than meteorological factors, and surface temperature has less influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City. © 2023 by the authors.",early warning of forest fire risk; forest fire drivers; live fuel moisture content; random forest,Contact angle; Decision trees; Deforestation; Evapotranspiration; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Global warming; Inverse problems; Machine learning; Moisture determination; Probability distributions; Random forests; Topography; Vegetation; Early warning; Early warning of forest fire risk; Fire risks; Forest fire driver; Forest fires; Fuel moisture content; Live fuel moisture; Live fuel moisture content; Random forests; Adaptive boosting

Different methods, including those that are physics-based, statistical, and based on machine learning (ML) are used in wildfire analysis. Among the whole, those based on machine learning are relatively novel. In addition, because the number of wildfires is much greater than the number of large wildfires, the dataset to be used in a ML model is imbalanced, resulting in overfitting or underfitting the results. In this manuscript, we propose to generate synthetic data from variables of interest together with ML models for the prediction of large wildfires. Specifically, five synthetic data generation methods have been evaluated, and their results are analyzed with four ML methods. The results yield an improvement in the prediction power when synthetic data are used, offering a new method to be taken into account in Decision Support Systems (DSS) when managing wildfires. © 2021 by the authors.

The increase in annual fire occurrence and the complexity of environmental factors affecting fire occurrence in the Zagros vegetation zone have increased the importance of modeling factors affecting fire occurrence in this region. Therefore, forecasting fire-prone areas and practical factors can help forest managers to prevent destructive fires. This study aims to modulate the fire-sensitive areas using machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and generalized linear model (GLM). Materials &Methods: Fire-effective factors were categorized into four classes (physiographic, biological, climatic, and anthropogenic factors) and 16 raster-based variables. The fire susceptibility maps were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) values extracted from the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. In addition, the RF model was used to determine the relative importance of each variable. Findings: Results showed that fires happened in the middle elevation (300-2000m), lower slopes (<20%), and in the west and southwest slope aspects. More fires were also in agricultural and residential areas. The validation of fire susceptibility maps showed that the RF model (AUC=0.911) has higher accuracy than the SVM (AUC=0.864) and GLM models (AUC=0.824). Based on the RF model, high and very high-risk had low areas (9.48 and 5.97%, respectively). The most effective factors on fire occurrence were anthropogenic (distance from residential, distance from agricultural lands, and distance from roads) and climatic factors (relative air humidity, wind speed, and slope aspect), and the least important factors were distance from rivers and slope aspect. Conclusion: Given the role of anthropogenic factors in the occurrence of fires, it is suggested that nature-based education be increased and people’s dependence on these forest ecosystems be reduced. Given the lack of sufficient information on fires and the importance of research on forest fires, it is recommended that a database of past and ongoing fires in the forests of the study area using remote sensing and geographic information systems and a history of fires in these areas be prepared to evaluate fire occurrence models in future research. © 2021, the Authors.",Generalized Linear Model; MODIS Fire Product; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine; Zagros,

To evaluate public health impacts of wildfire smoke, we integrated numerical simulations and observations for regional fire events during August-September of 2017. A one-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting and Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system was used to simulate fire smoke transport and dispersion. To reduce modeling bias in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and to optimize smoke exposure estimates, we integrated modeling results with the high-resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction satellite aerosol optical depth and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency AirNow ground-level monitoring PM2.5 concentrations. Three machine learning-based data fusion algorithms were applied: An ordinary multi-linear regression method, a generalized boosting method, and a random forest (RF) method. 10-Fold cross-validation found improved surface PM2.5 estimation after data integration and bias correction, especially with the RF method. Lastly, to assess transient health effects of fire smoke, we applied the optimized high-resolution PM2.5 exposure estimate in a short-term exposure-response function. Total estimated regional mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure during the smoke episode was 183 (95% confidence interval: 0, 432), with 85% of the PM2.5 pollution and 95% of the consequent multiple-cause mortality contributed by fire emissions. This application demonstrates both the profound health impacts of fire smoke over the PNW and the need for a high-performance fire smoke forecasting and reanalysis system to reduce public health risks of smoke hazards in fire-prone regions.",fire smoke modeling; PM2.5 air pollution; machine learning-based data fusion; health impact assessment,WILDLAND FIRE SMOKE; PARTICULATE MATTER; ORGANIC AEROSOL; AIR-QUALITY; EXPOSURE; VOLATILITY; EMISSIONS; TRANSPORT; OXIDATION; SYSTEM

With the present work, we continue with a research framework developed in a pioneristic study at the local scale for Liguria (Italy) and recently adapted to the national scale. In these previous works, a random-forest-based modeling workflow was developed to assess susceptibility to wildfires under the influence of a number of environmental predictors. The main novelties and contributions of the present study are: (i) we compared models based on random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and support vector machine, to estimate their prediction capabilities; (ii) we used a more accurate vegetation map as predictor, allowing us to evaluate the impacts of different types of local and neighboring vegetation on wildfires' occurrence; (iii) we improved the selection of the testing dataset, in order to take into account the temporal variability of the burning seasons. Wildfire susceptibility maps were finally created based on the output probabilistic predicted values from the three machine-learning algorithms.

The RAPT (RAre Class Prediction in the absence of True labels) framework is able to build data adaptive classification models using noisy training labels. It is particularly suitable when expert annotated training samples are difficult to obtain as in the case of wild fires in the tropics. This framework has been used to build burned area maps from MODIS surface reflectance data as features and Active Fire hotspots as training labels that are known to have high commission and omission errors due to the prevalence of cloud cover and smoke, especially in the tropics. Using the RAPT framework we report burned areas for 16 MODIS tiles from 2001 to 2014. The total burned area detected in the tropical forests of South America and South-east Asia during these years is 2,071,378 MODIS (500 m) pixels (approximately 520 K sq. km.), which is almost three times compared to the estimates from collection 5 MODIS MCD64A1 (783,468 MODIS pixels). An evaluation using Landsat-based reference burned area maps indicates that our product has an average user's accuracy of 53% and producer's accuracy of 55% while collection 5 MCD64A1 burned area product has an average user's accuracy of 61% and producer's accuracy of 27%. Our analysis also indicates that the two products can be complimentary and a combination of the two approaches is likely to provide a more comprehensive assessment of tropical fires. Finally, we have created a publicly accessible web-based viewer that helps the community to visualize the burned area maps produced using RAPT and examine various validation sources corresponding to every detected MODIS pixel.",MODIS; burned area mapping; tropical forests; machine learning,FIRE EMISSIONS; BOREAL FOREST; CLOUD SHADOW; ALGORITHM; MODIS; PRODUCTS; IMAGERY; AVHRR

Here, we combined a locally weighted learning (LWL) algorithm with the Cascade Generalization (CG), Bagging, Decorate, and Dagging ensemble learning techniques for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility in the Pu Mat National Park, Nghe An Province, Vietnam. A geospatial database that contained records from 56 historical fires and nine explanatory variables was employed to train the standalone LWL model and its derived ensemble models. The models were validated for their goodness-of-fit and predictive capability using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and several other statistical performance criteria.

We constructed a matched case-control conditional light gradient boosting machine (MCC CLightGBM) to model these environment models and analyzed the factors influencing fire boundary formation and the spatial locations of the predicted boundaries. Our results show that the MCC CLightGBM model performs better when points on the selected boundaries are paired with points within the burned areas, specifically between 120 m and 480 m away from the boundaries. By using the MCC CLightGBM model to predict the probability of boundary formation under six environmental models at different distances, we found that fire boundaries are most likely to form near roads and populated areas. Boundary formation is also influenced by areas with significant topographic relief. It should be noted explicitly that this conclusion is only applicable to this study region and has not been validated for other different regions. Finally, the matched case-control conditional random forest (MCC CRF) model was constructed for comparison experiments. The MCC CLightGBM model demonstrates potential in predicting fire boundaries and fills a gap in research on fire boundary predictions in this area which can be useful in future forest fire management, allowing for a quick and intuitive assessment of where a fire has stopped.",fire boundaries; MCC CLightGBM; MCC CRF; influencing factors,PERIMETER

A cellular automaton (CA) is well suited to the dynamic simulation of the spatiotemporal evolution of complex systems, and it is therefore used to model the complex process of forest fire spread. However, the process of forest fire spread is linked with a variety of mutually influencing factors, which are too complex to analyze using conventional approaches. Here, we propose a new method for modeling fire spread, namely LSSVM-CA, in which least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) is combined with a three-dimensional forest fire CA framework. In this approach, the effects of adjacent wind on the law of fire spread are considered and analyzed. The LSSVM is utilized to derive the complex state transformation rules for fire spread by training with a dataset based on actual local data. To validate the proposed model, the forest fire spread area simulated by LSSVM-CA and the actual extracted forest fire spread area were subjected to cross-comparison. The results show that LSSVM-CA performs well in simulating the spread of forest fire and determining the probability of forest fire.",cellular automaton (CA); machine learning; forest fire simulating; least squares support vector machines (LSSVM); three-dimensional,WILDFIRE; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; PROPAGATION; PREDICTIONS; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS; SURFACE; DESIGN

Applied nucleation (AN) could be a valuable active restoration approach for promoting natural recovery in forest ecosystems affected by stand-replacing disturbances as it improves seed availability and microsite conditions.Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the potential of AN under different scenarios in a mountain forest ecosystem of the Northwestern Italian Alps dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The area was affected by a large stand-replacing fire in 2005 and post-fire salvage logging that amplified ecosystem degradation and dampened natural tree regeneration.Methods: We assessed the main drivers guiding natural post-fire natural recovery and identified suitable sites for tree regeneration through a machine learning correlative model (Bayesian Additive Regression Tree, BART). Specifically, we used several environmental predictors (e.g., topography, wind direction, and distance from seed trees) to model the occurrence of natural tree regeneration. We predicted the probability of tree regeneration presence at landscape scale under the current situation (fire followed by salvage logging) and a set of AN scenarios characterized by an increase in nuclei density, since distance from seed trees emerged as the most important driver for natural tree regeneration. Starting from the situation 16 years after the fire, we reclassified the prediction raster into a binary map of intervention priority (priority and non-priority patches), using the probability value that maximized the model accuracy (true skill statistic; TSS) as threshold. Patches with scarce pine regeneration were considered as high intervention priority sites for AN. These predictions made it possible to assess the most efficient active management scenario in terms of promoting forest recovery.Conclusions: The simulations showed the positive effects of AN on natural tree regeneration and the importance of site selection for plantations, proving that AN could be a promising post-fire management technique that can minimize human interventions and their associated economic and ecological costs. To our knowledge, this work is the first AN simulation in a temperate mountain ecosystem. The selection of favorable sites can be further improved by considering fine-scale characteristics through field experiments and cross-scale integration.",Applied nucleation; Ecological restoration; Natural regeneration drivers; Post-fire management; Scots pine; Spatial modeling,PINUS-SYLVESTRIS L.; SCOTS PINE; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS; FIRE; MANAGEMENT; ELEVATION; WILDFIRES; DROUGHT; SHIFTS

Wildfires are a type of disturbance that can affect many aspects of an ecosystem and its species. Therefore, through the integration of spatial models and species distribution models (SDMs), we can make informed predictions of the occurrence of such phenomena and their potential impacts. This study focused on five focal species, namely, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), wild sheep (Ovis orientalis), wildcat (Felis silvestris), and striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena). This study used MODIS active fire data and ensemble machine learning methods to model the risk of wildfire occurrence in 2023 for spring, summer, and autumn separately. This study also investigated the suitability of habitats for focal species via SDMs. The predicted probability maps for wildfire risk and habitat suitability were converted to binary values via the true skill statistic (TSS) threshold. The overlap of the habitat suitability map and wildfire occurrence areas was analyzed via GAP analysis. The area prone to fire in spring, summer and winter is equal to 9077.32; 10,199.83 and 13,723.49 KM2 were calculated, which indicates an increase in wildfire risk. Proximity to roads is one of the most important factors affecting the possible effects of wildfires in all seasons. Most fire occurrences are concentrated on agricultural lands, which, when integrated with other land use types, have wildfire potential in all seasons. The use of fire to destroy agricultural residues is a critical factor in the occurrence of wildfires. The distribution range of each focal species is considered the most important component of fire susceptibility. Hence, the suitable habitat for Hyaena hyaena in spring, summer, and autumn, with areas of 5.257, 5.856, and 6.889 km2 respectively, is the most affected by the possibility of fire. In contrast, these areas have the lowest values for Ovis orientalis, with 162, 127, and 396 km2 respectively. Therefore, species that are dependent on human-based ecosystems have the highest vulnerability to wildfire. Conservation efforts should focus on familiarizing farmers with methods of destroying agricultural residues as well as the consequences of intentional fires. The findings of this study can be used to mitigate the negative impacts of wildfire and protect the habitat of focal species. © 2024 Morovati, Karami.

Chile, with its diverse geography and climate, faces escalating wildfire frequency and intensity due to climate change. This study employs a spatial machine learning approach using a Random Forest algorithm to predict wildfire risk in Central and Southern Chile under current and future climatic scenarios. The model was trained on a time series dataset incorporating climatic, land use, and physiographic variables, with burned-area scars as the response variable. By applying this model to three projected climate scenarios, this study forecasts the spatial distribution of wildfire probabilities for multiple future periods. The model’s performance was high, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.91 for testing and 0.87 for validation. The accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), and True Negative Rate (TNR) values were 0.80, 0.87, and 0.73, respectively. Currently, the prediction of wildfire risk in Mediterranean-type climate areas and the central Araucanía are most at risk, particularly in agricultural zones and rural–urban interfaces. However, future projections indicate a southward expansion of wildfire risk, with an overall increase in probabilities as climate scenarios become more pessimistic. These findings offer a framework for policymakers, facilitating evidence-based strategies for adaptive land management and effective mitigation of wildfire risk. © 2025 by the authors.",climate change scenarios; fire risk prediction; Random Forest; spatial modeling; wildfires,

In this paper, we propose a wildfire spread model with an irregular graph network (IGN). This model implemented an IGN generation algorithm to characterize the wildland landscape with a variable scale, adaptively encoding complex regions with dense nodes and simple regions with sparse nodes. Then, a deep learning-based spread model is designed to calculate the spread duration of each graph edge under variable environmental conditions. Comparative experiments between the IGN model and widely used fire simulation models were conducted on a real wildfire in Getty, California, USA.

We develop a novel machine learning model to predict post-fire burn severity using pre-fire remotely sensed data. Hydrological, ecological, and topographical variables collected from four regions of California — the site of the Kincade fire (2019), the CZU Lightning Complex fire (2020), the Windy fire (2021), and the KNP Fire (2021) — are used as predictors of the differenced normalized burn ratio. We hypothesize that a Super Learner (SL) algorithm that accounts for spatial autocorrelation using Vecchia’s Gaussian approximation will accurately model burn severity. We use a cross-validation study to show that the spatial SL model can predict burn severity with reasonable classification accuracy, including high burn severity events. After fitting and verifying the performance of the SL model, we use interpretable machine learning tools to determine the main drivers of severe burn damage, including greenness, elevation, and fire weather variables. These findings provide actionable insights that enable communities to strategize interventions, such as early fire detection systems, pre-fire season vegetation clearing activities, and resource allocation during emergency responses.

Forest fires alter forest structure and composition; threaten people's livelihoods; and lead to economic losses, as well as soil erosion and desertification. Climate change and related drought events, paired with anthropogenic activities, have magnified the intensity and frequency of forest fires. Consequently, we analysed forest fire susceptibility (FFS), which can be understood as the likelihood of fire occurrence in a certain area. We applied a random forest (RF) machine learning (ML) algorithm to model current and future FFS in the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany) using topographic, climatic, anthropogenic, soil, and vegetation predictors. FFS was modelled at a spatial resolution of 50m for current (2014-2022) and future scenarios (2081-2100). Model accuracy ranged between 69% (RFtest) and 71% (leave one year out, LOYO), showing a moderately high model reliability for predicting FFS. The model results underscore the importance of anthropogenic parameters and vegetation parameters in modelling FFS on a regional level.

In this study, 15 environmental features encompassing meteorological, topographical, ecological, in situ and anthropogenic factors have been considered for preparing the wildfire likelihood map of Sikkim Himalaya. A comparative study on the efficiency of machine learning methods like Generalized Linear Model, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) has been performed to identify the best performing algorithm in wildfire prediction. The study indicates that all the machine learning methods are good at predicting wildfires. However, RF has outperformed, followed by GBM in the prediction. Also, environmental features like average temperature, average wind speed, proximity to roadways and tree cover percentage are the most important determinants of wildfires in Sikkim Himalaya.

However, some limitations remain in acquiring insights from data, such as the risk of overfitting caused by insufficient datasets. Moreover, most previous studies have only focused on detecting fires or smoke, whereas detecting persons and other objects of interest is equally crucial for wildfire response strategies. Therefore, this study developed a multilabel classification (MLC) model, which applies transfer learning and data augmentation and outputs multiple pieces of information on the same object or image. VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121 were used as pretrained models for transfer learning. The models were trained using the dataset constructed in this study and were compared based on various performance metrics. Moreover, the use of control variable methods revealed that transfer learning and data augmentation can perform better when used in the proposed MLC model. The resulting visualization is a heatmap processed from gradient-weighted class activation mapping that shows the reliability of predictions and the posi-tion of each class. The MLC model can address the limitations of existing forest fire identification algorithms, which mostly focuses on binary classification.

To combine the advantages of pixelwise machine learning (ML) method and region-based deep learning (DL) segmentation model, this study proposes a two-phase hybrid framework for near real-time burned area progression mapping: the first one intends to depict burned area delimitation using a contextual algorithm HRNet to exclude the unburned areas outside the perimeter and minimize omission errors, which partially remain unburned patches within the delimitation as commission errors. The second phase refines the burned area spatially using ensemble fusion based on an updating support vector machine (SVM) model under the voting scheme as new imagery arrives to reduce the commission errors consecutively. The validation results showed that the accuracy of perimeter prediction using the HRNet can reach 96.77% in Kappa. The iterative optimization can improve the average Kappa value from 62.55% to 70.75% for burned area pixel classification using pixelwise SVM alone.

However, the increase in its recurrence and intensity, as well as accidental fires can lead to socioeconomic and environmental losses.

To do so, we analyzed the best combination of three ML algorithms and how long it takes to consider a historical time series able to support accurate AF predictions. We used the most accurate combination for the final model (FM) development. The results show that the FM ensures an overall accuracy rate of approximately 80%. The FM potential is remarkable not only for single detections but also for a consecutive sequence of positive predictions. Roughly, the FM achieves an accuracy rate peak after around 20 h of consecutive AF detections, but there is an important trade-off between the accuracy and the time required to assemble more fire indications, which can be decisive for firefighters in real life. © 2022 by the authors.

Satellite imagery platforms, in particular geostationary satellites with high temporal resolution, allow for real-time fire monitoring. However, because of the coarse resolution of geostationary satellite images, even when deep learning models are applied, precision still remains limited. Thus, the prediction models easily fall into a local optimal solution because of the insufficient semantic information from low spatial resolution. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a novel deep learning model, SBT-FireNet, to monitor fire spots from Himawari-8 satellite images. Specifically, the extraction modules of spatial, band, and time-series features were designed and integrated into the model. The spatial feature extraction module served to collate information about fires and their surrounding environment, while the band and time-series features were designed to obtain fire-sensitive band and time information, respectively. The newly structured SBT-FireNet model was tested in four fire-prone areas with high forest cover. The precision of SBT-FireNet in four test areas is 35.2% higher than other methods. The model yielded significant improvements through the combination of the modules of spatial, band, and time-series features and their fire-tailored design.

Existing DL-based techniques, which are mostly based on convolutional networks, have proven to be effective in wildfire detection. However, there is still room for improvement. First, existing methods tend to have some commercial aspects, with limited publicly available data and models. In addition, studies aiming at the detection of wildfires at the incipient stage are rare. Smoke columns at this stage tend to be small, shallow, and often far from view, with low visibility. This makes finding and labeling enough data to train an efficient deep learning model very challenging. Finally, the inherent locality of convolution operators limits their ability to model long-range correlations between objects in an image. Recently, encoder–decoder transformers have emerged as interesting solutions beyond natural language processing to help capture global dependencies via self- and inter-attention mechanisms. We propose Nemo: a set of evolving, free, and open-source datasets, processed in standard COCO format, and wildfire smoke and fine-grained smoke density detectors, for use by the research community. We adapt Facebook’s DEtection TRansformer (DETR) to wildfire detection, which results in a much simpler technique, where the detection does not rely on convolution filters and anchors. Nemo is the first open-source benchmark for wildfire smoke density detection and Transformer-based wildfire smoke detection tailored to the early incipient stage. Two popular object detection algorithms (Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) are used as alternatives and baselines for extensive evaluation. Our results confirm the superior performance of the transformer-based method in wildfire smoke detection across different object sizes. Moreover, we tested our model with 95 video sequences of wildfire starts from the public HPWREN database. Our model detected 97.9% of the fires in the incipient stage and 80% within 5 min from the start.

This work introduced a novel methodology combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP multi-criteria methods, and spatial data to detect potential forest fire vulnerability areas using twenty variables. The results from AHP or fuzzy AHP, were processed using a multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation algorithm. The final ANN model has two objectives: first, to create a forest fire vulnerability with four classes (low, moderate, high, and very high), and second, to classify burned area sizes in regions highly or very highly vulnerable to fire. Evaluation metrics were also applied for validation. The fire model was tested using both literature review data and in situ observations. Comparative analysis showed that the burned area size model performed better than other machine learning methods, achieving an accuracy score of 89%. Meanwhile, the fire vulnerability model scored 82%. The study addresses the problem of prediction and provides an algorithm for classifying fire risk based on historical data in the Czech Republic, offering a master model for future forest management. Therefore, the ANN model, once trained, validated, and tested, does not require resetting and is effective for estimating forest fire vulnerability. Moreover, it produces results quickly, providing rapid insights into complex forest ecosystems, saving time and enhancing understanding for decision-makers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Analytical hierarchy process/fuzzy decision analysis; Artificial neural network process; Burned area size; Forest fire vulnerability model; Geographical information system; Multilayer perceptron classification,Multilayer neural networks; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Analytical hierarchy process/fuzzy decision analyze; Artificial neural network process; Burned area size; Burned areas; Forest fire vulnerability model; Forest fires; Fuzzy decision analysis; Geographical information; Geographical information system; Multilayer perceptron classification; Multilayers perceptrons; Network process; Neural-networks; Vulnerability models; Premixed flames
Nguyen Van L.; Lee G.,"Nguyen Van, Linh (58045719400); Lee, Giha (35069799400)",Optimizing Stacked Ensemble Machine Learning Models For Accurate Wildfire Severity Mapping,2025,Remote Sensing,"Wildfires are increasingly frequent and severe, posing substantial risks to ecosystems, communities, and infrastructure. Accurately mapping wildfire severity (WSM) using remote sensing and machine learning (ML) is critical for evaluating damages, informing recovery efforts, and guiding long-term mitigation strategies. Stacking ensemble ML (SEML) enhances predictive accuracy and robustness by combining multiple diverse models into a single meta-learned predictor. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of individual base learners while reducing variance, ultimately improving model reliability. This study aims to optimize a SEML framework to (1) identify the most effective ML models for use as base learners and meta-learners, and (2) determine the optimal number of base models needed for robust and accurate wildfire severity predictions. The study utilizes six ML models—Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Adaptive Boosting (AB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—to construct an SEML. To quantify wildfire impacts, we extracted 118 spectral indices from post-fire Landsat-8 data and incorporated four additional predictors (land cover, elevation, slope, and aspect). A dataset of 911 CBI observations from 18 wildfire events was used for training, and models were validated through cross-validation and bootstrapping to ensure robustness. To address multicollinearity and reduce computational complexity, we applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and condensed the dataset into three primary components. Our results indicated that simpler models, notably LR and KNN, performed well as meta-learners, with LR achieving the highest predictive accuracy. Moreover, using only two base learners (RF and SVM) was sufficient to realize optimal SEML performance, with an overall accuracy and precision of 0.661, recall of 0.662, and F1-score of 0.656. These findings demonstrate that SEML can enhance wildfire severity mapping by improving prediction accuracy and supporting more informed resource allocation and management decisions. Future research should explore additional meta-learning approaches and incorporate emerging remote sensing data sources such as hyperspectral and LiDAR. © 2025 by the authors.",Landsat satellite; stacking ensemble machine learning; wildfire management; wildfire severity mapping,Adaptive boosting; Contrastive Learning; Damage detection; Federated learning; Landsat; Nearest neighbor search; Photomapping; Premixed flames; Random forests; Support vector regression; Base learners; Landsat satellite; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Predictive accuracy; Stacking ensemble machine learning; Stackings; Wildfire management; Wildfire severity; Wildfire severity mapping; Adversarial machine learning

In this paper, we introduce an efficient parameter flexible fire prediction algorithm based on machine learning and reduced order modelling techniques. Using a training dataset generated by physics-based fire simulations, the method forecasts burned area at different time steps with a low computational cost. We then address the bottleneck of efficient parameter estimation by developing a novel inverse approach relying on data assimilation techniques (latent assimilation) in the reduced order space. The forward and the inverse modellings are tested on two recent large wildfire events in California. Satellite observations are used to validate the forward prediction approach and identify the model parameters. By combining these forward and inverse approaches, the system manages to integrate real-time observations for parameter adjustment, leading to more accurate future predictions. © 2022 by the authors.

Forest fires are a serious issue that may cause significant loss of life and infrastructure. Forest fires may occur due to human or man-made climate effects. Numerous artificial intelligence-based strategies such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have helped researchers to predict forest fires. However, ML and DL strategies pose some challenges such as large multidimensional data, communication lags, transmission latency, lack of processing power, and privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a recent development in ML that enables the collection and process of multidimensional, large volumes of data efficiently, which has the potential to solve the aforementioned challenges. FL can also help in identifying the trends based on the geographical locations that can help the authorities to respond faster to forest fires. However, FL algorithms send and receive large amounts of weights of the client-side trained models, and also it induces significant communication overhead. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose a unified framework based on FL with a particle swarm-optimization algorithm (PSO) that enables the authorities to respond faster to forest fires. The proposed PSO-enabled FL framework is evaluated by using multidimensional forest fire image data from Kaggle. In comparison to the state-of-the-art federated average model, the proposed model performed better in situations of data imbalance, incurred lower communication costs, and thus proved to be more network efficient. The results of the proposed framework have been validated and 94.47% prediction accuracy has been recorded. These results obtained by the proposed framework can serve as a useful component in the development of early warning systems for forest fires. © 2023 by the authors.

This study evaluates the abilities of the Bayes Network (BN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Multivariate Logistic Regression (MLP) machine learning methods for the prediction and mapping fire susceptibility across the Pu Mat National Park, Nghe An Province, Vietnam. The modeling methodology was formulated based on processing the information from the 57 historical fires and a set of nine spatially explicit explanatory variables, namely elevation, slope degree, aspect, average annual temperate, drought index, river density, land cover, and distance from roads and residential areas. Using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and seven other performance metrics, the models were validated in terms of their abilities to elucidate the general fire behaviors in the Pu Mat National Park and to predict future fires. Despite a few differences between the AUC values, the BN model with an AUC value of 0.96 was dominant over the other models in predicting future fires. The second best was the DT model (AUC = 0.94), followed by the NB (AUC = 0.939), and MLR (AUC = 0.937) models. Our robust analysis demonstrated that these models are sufficiently robust in response to the training and validation datasets change. Further, the results revealed that moderate to high levels of fire susceptibilities are associated with similar to 19% of the Pu Mat National Park where human activities are numerous.

Existing methods to quantify this burn probability involve simulating the spread of many thousands of individual wildfires, making them highly computationally expensive. To reduce this expense, we propose strategies that enable the development of computationally efficient machine learning assisted metamodels for estimating burn probability, which are demonstrated for a case study in South Australia. Artificial neural networks are used as the metamodel to emulate the outputs of a landscape fire simulation model. Development of the metamodel is facilitated by reducing the input and output dimensionality of the simulation model by a factor of 10,000–1,000,000, while still being able to predict burn probabilities with high accuracy (approximately ± 7.4% error, on average) and only requiring 0.6% of the computational time compared with an approach using landscape fire simulation models.

Pre-fire severity predictions can expedite mitigation efforts because precipitation contributing to these hazards often occurs shortly after wildfires, leaving little time for post-fire planning and management. Aim: The aim of this study was to predict burn severity using pre-fire conditions of individual wildfire events and estimate potential post-fire debris flow to unburned areas. Methods: We used random forests to model dNBR from pre-fire weather, fuels, topography, and remotely sensed data. We validated our model predictions against post-fire observations and potential post-fire debris-flow hazard estimates. Key results: Fuels, pre-fire weather, and topography were important predictors of burn severity, although predictor importance varied between fires. Post-fire debris-flow hazard rankings from predicted burn severity (pre-fire) were similar to hazard assessments based on observed burn severity (post-fire). Conclusion: Predicted burn severity can serve as an input to post-fire debris-flow models before wildfires occur, antecedent to standard post-fire burn severity products. Assessing a larger set of fires under disparate conditions and landscapes will be needed to refine predictive models. Implications: Burn severity models based on pre-fire conditions enable the prediction of fire effects and identification of potential hazards to prioritise response and mitigation. © 2023 CSIRO.

The purpose of this study was to develop an intelligent system based on genetic programming for the prediction of burned areas, using only data related to the forest under analysis and meteorological data.

There is an urgent need to study the growth rate of fire-burned areas to fill the research gap in this region. To address this issue, this study uses the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters in the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, constructing a GWO-XGBoost model. Finally, the optimized ensemble model (GWO-XGBoost) is used to create a fire growth rate warning map for the Liangshan Prefecture in Sichuan Province, China, filling the research gap in forest fire studies in this area. This study comprehensively selects factors such as monthly climate, monthly vegetation, terrain, and socio–economic aspects and incorporates monthly reanalysis data from forest fire assessment systems in Canada, the United States, and Australia as features to construct the forest fire dataset. After collinearity tests to filter redundant features and Pearson correlation analysis to explore features related to the burned area growth rate, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to oversample the positive class samples. The GWO algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters in the XGBoost model, constructing the GWO-XGBoost model, which is then compared with XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) models. Model evaluation results showed that the GWO-XGBoost model, with an AUC value of 0.8927, is the best-performing model. Using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis method to quantify the contribution of each influencing factor indicates that the Ignition Component (IC) value from the United States National Fire Danger Rating System contributes the most, followed by the average monthly temperature and the population density.

Subsequently, a robust fire severity model was developed by incorporating 19 variables, including biophysical, topographic, climatic, and vegetation-related factors. The RF classification achieved noteworthy performance metrics, with an overall accuracy of 0.75, a Kappa value of 0.61, and a macro-average AUC value of 0.88. Furthermore, the integration of SHAP analysis provided insightful contributions to the RF classification model, elucidating the impacts of individual input features.

Forest fires contributed to the ecological balance by destroying old and diseased plant material; but in the modern era fires are a major problem that tests the endurance not only of government agencies around the world, but also have an effect on climate change. Forest fires have become more intense, more destructive, and more deadly; these are known as megafires. They can cause major economic and ecological problems, especially in the summer months (dry season). However, humanity has developed a tool that can predict fire events, to detect them in time, but also to predict their duration.

Identifying where these flammable species grow through time in the landscape is critical for understanding wildfire risk, damages, and human exposure. Because medium resolution landcover data that include species detail are lacking, we developed a compound modeling approach that enabled us to refine the available evergreen forest category into highly flammable species and less flammable species. We then expanded our refined landcover at decadal time steps from 1984 to 2014.

To help land and fire management agencies manage and mitigate wildfire-related risks, we need to develop tools for mapping those risks. Big geodata—in the form of remotely sensed images, ground-based sensor observations, and topographical datasets—can help us characterize the dynamics of wildfire related events. In this study, we design a deep fully convolutional network, called AllConvNet, to produce daily maps of the probability of a wildfire burn over the next 7 days. We applied it to burns in Victoria, Australia for the period of 2006–2017. Fifteen factors that were extracted from six different datasets and resulted into 29 quantitative features, were selected as input to the network. We compared it with three baseline methods: SegNet, multilayer perceptron, and logistic regression. AllConvNet outperforms the other three baseline methods in four of the six quantitative metrics considered. AllConvNet and SegNet provide smoother and more regularized predicted maps, with SegNet providing greater sensitivity in dificriminating less wildfire-prone locations. Input feature statistical importance was measured for all the networks and compared against logistic regression coefficients. Total precipitation, lightning flash density, and land surface temperature occur to be consistently highly weighted by all models while terrain aspect components, wind direction components, certain land cover classes (such as crop field and woodland), and distance from power lines are ranked on the lower end. We conclude that wild-fire burn prediction methods based on deep learning present quantitative and qualitative gains. © 2021",Big geodata; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Input statistical importance; Wildfire burn prediction,Convolution; Deep learning; Fires; Land surface temperature; Regression analysis; fuel; rain; Baseline methods; Big geodata; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Environmental problems; Geo-data; Input statistical importance; Land managements; Logistics regressions; Wildfire burn prediction; AllConvNet; Article; artificial neural network; Australia; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cropland; forest; humidity; intermethod comparison; lightning flash density; logistic regression analysis; multilayer perceptron; precipitation; probability; semantic segmentation; solar radiation; temperature; weather; wildfire; wind speed; Forecasting

Post wildland fire assessments suggest that this mechanism is one of the leading causes of home destruction in wildland urban interface (WUI) fires. However, the process of ember deposition and accumulation on and around houses remains poorly understood. Herein, we develop a deep learning (DL) model to analyze data from a series of ember-related wind tunnel experiments for a range of wind conditions and roof slopes. The developed model is designed to identify building roof regions where embers will remain in contact with the rooftop. Our results show that the DL model is capable of accurately predicting the position and fraction of the roof on which embers remain in place as a function of the wind speed, wind direction, roof slope, and location on the windward and leeward faces of the rooftop. The DL model was augmented with explainable AI (XAI) measures to examine the extent of the influence of these parameters on the rooftop ember coverage and potential ignition. © 2024 by the authors.",deep learning model; ember; rooftop; spot fire; wildfire prediction; wildland fire,
Zaidi A.,"Zaidi, Abdelhamid (9241739100)",Predicting Wildfires In Algerian Forests Using Machine Learning Models,2023,Heliyon,"Algeria is one of the Maghreb countries most affected by wildfires. The economic, environmental, and societal consequences of these fires can last several years after the wildfire. Often, it is possible to avoid such disasters if the detection of the outbreak of fire is fast enough, reliable, and early. The lack of datasets has limited the methods used to predict wildfires in Algeria to the mapping risk areas, which is updated annually. This study is the result of the availability of a recent dataset relating the history of forest fires in the cities of Bejaia and Sidi Bel-Abbes during the year 2012. The dataset being small size, we used principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables to 6, while retaining 96.65% of the total variance. Moreover, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN) with two hidden layers to predict wildfires in these cities. Next, we trained and compared the performance of our classifier with those provided by the Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest classifiers, using a 10-fold stratified cross-validation. The experiment shows a slight superiority of the ANN classifier compared to the others, in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Our classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.967±0.026 and F1-score of 0.971±0.023.

It is applied to a well-studied forest-fire dataset from Portugal Montesinho Natural Park considering 13 input variables. The total burned area distribution of the 517 burn events in that dataset is highly positively skewed. The model is transparent and avoids regressions and hidden layers. This increases its detailed data mining capabilities. It matches the highest burned-area prediction accuracy achieved for this dataset with a wide range of traditional machine learning algorithms. The two-stage prediction process provides informative feature selection that establishes the relative influences of the input variables on burned-area predictions. Optimizing with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as separate objective functions provides complementary information with which to data mine each total burned-area incident. Such insight offers potential agricultural, ecological, environmental and forestry benefits by improving the understanding of the key influences associated with each burn event. Data mining the differential trends of cumulative absolute error and squared error also provides detailed insight with which to determine the suitability of each optimized solution to accurately predict burned-areas events of specific types. Such prediction accuracy and insight leads to confidence in how each prediction is derived. It provides knowledge to make appropriate responses and mitigate specific burn incidents, as they occur. Such informed responses should lead to short-term and long-term multi-faceted benefits by helping to prevent certain types of burn incidents being repeated or spread. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Cumulative absolute error differentials; Data-matched prediction accuracy; Non-regression machine learning; Predicting highly skewed distributions; Wildfire feature selection,Deforestation; Errors; Feature Selection; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Absolute error; Cumulative absolute error differential; Data-matched prediction accuracy; Features selection; Machine-learning; Non-regression machine learning; Predicting highly skewed distribution; Prediction accuracy; Skewed distribution; Wildfire feature selection; Data mining

Fire danger indexes, such as the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), measure the potential wildfire danger at a given time and location. Thus, by predicting these fire danger indexes in advance, power system operators can obtain valuable insight into the potential wildfire risks and can better be prepared to tackle the wildfires. However, due to dependency on weather conditions, these indexes usually have volatile time series, which make their prediction complex. Taking these facts into account, this paper, unlike previous approaches that predict fire danger indexes based on climatological models, develops a machine learning-based forecast process to predict these indexes using the relevant weather data and past performance. To do this, first, a volatility analysis approach is presented to analyse the volatility level of the time series data of a fire danger index. Afterwards, an effective machine learning-based forecast methodology using a new deep feature selection model is proposed to predict fire danger indexes.

Then, two recursive feature elimination algorithms based on the Lasso and the Random Forest (RF) models were employed separately for feature selection, resulting in two different low-dimensional feature subsets and a control group. Finally, different feature subsets were input to analyse and compare the prediction performance on the heat release rate of three typical algorithms: linear regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and lightGBM. Results indicate that the LightGBM model trained with the feature subset selected by the recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the Random Forest model exhibits the best predictive performance, with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 23.89 kW and 15.49 kW respectively, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9916.

The eastern region of China is particularly susceptible to frequent forest fires, characterized by high population density and vibrant economic activities. Precise forecasting in this area is essential for devising effective prevention strategies. This research utilizes a blend of kernel density analysis, autocorrelation analysis, and the standard deviation ellipse method, augmented by geographic information systems (GISs) and deep-learning techniques, to develop an accurate prediction system for forest-fire occurrences. The deep-learning model incorporates data on meteorological conditions, topography, vegetation, infrastructure, and socio-cultural factors to produce monthly forecasts and assessments. This approach enables the identification of spatial patterns and temporal trends in fire occurrences, enhancing both the precision and breadth of the predictions. The results show that global and local autocorrelation analyses reveal high-incidence areas mainly concentrated in Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces, with cities like Jiangmen exhibiting distinct concentration characteristics and a varied spatial distribution of fire occurrences. Kernel density analysis further pinpoints high-density fire zones primarily in Meizhou, Qingyuan, and Jiangmen in Guangdong Province, and Dongfang City in Hainan Province. Standard deviation ellipse and centroid shift analysis indicate a significant northward shift in the fire-occurrence centroid over the past 20 years, with an expanding spatial distribution range, decreasing flattening, and relatively stable fire-occurrence direction. The model performs effectively on the validation set, achieving an accuracy of 80.6%, an F1 score of 81.6%, and an AUC of 88.2%, demonstrating its practical applicability. Moreover, monthly fire zoning analysis reveals that high-incidence areas in spring and winter are mainly concentrated in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hainan, while autumn shows widespread medium-incidence areas, and summer presents lower fire occurrences in most regions.

The model demonstrated notable accuracy with a F1-score of 0.846 ± 0.012, surpassing process-driven fire danger indices and four commonly used ML models by up to 40% and 9%, respectively. More importantly, the ML model showed remarkably higher interpretability relative to other ML models. Specifically, by demystifying the “black box” of each ML model using the explainable AI techniques, we identified substantial structural differences across ML fire models, even among those with similar accuracy. The relationships between fires and their drivers, identified by our model, were aligned closer with established fire physical principles. The ML structural discrepancy led to diverse fire predictions and our model predictions exhibited greater consistency with actual fire occurrence. With the highly interpretable and accurate model, we revealed the strong compound effects from multiple climate variables related to evaporative demand, energy release component, temperature, and wind speed, on the dynamics of large fires and megafires in the western US.

However, due to the unavailability of spatial information technology, such databases are extremely difficult to build reliably and completely in the non-satellite era. This study presented an improved forest fire risk reconstruction framework that integrates a deep learning-based time series prediction model and spatial interpolation to address the challenge in Sichuan Province, southwestern China. First, the forest fire danger index (FFDI) was improved by supplementing slope and aspect information. We compared the performances of three time series models, namely, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Prophet and long short-term memory (LSTM) in predicting the modified forest fire danger index (MFFDI). The best-performing model was used to retrace the MFFDI of individual stations from 1941 to 1970. Following this, the Anusplin spatial interpolation method was used to map the distributions of the MFFDI at five-year intervals, which were then subjected to weighted overlay with the distance-to-river layer to generate forest fire risk maps for reconstructing the forest fire danger database. The results revealed LSTM as the most accurate in fitting and predicting the historical MFFDI, with a fitting determination coefficient (R2) of 0.709, mean square error (MSE) of 0.047, and validation R2 and MSE of 0.508 and 0.11, respectively. Independent validation of the predicted forest fire risk maps indicated that 5 out of 7 historical forest fire events were located in forest fire-prone areas, which is higher than the results determined from the original FFDI (2 out of 7).

While high-fidelity models derived from first principles offer physical accuracy, they are too computationally expensive for use in real-time fire response. Low-fidelity models sacrifice some physical accuracy and generalizability via the integration of empirical measurements, but enable real-time simulations for operational use in fire response. Machine learning techniques have demonstrated the ability to bridge these objectives by learning first-principles physics while achieving computational speedups. While deep learning approaches have demonstrated the ability to predict wildfire propagation over large time periods, time-resolved fire-spread predictions are needed for active fire management. In this work, we evaluate the ability of deep learning approaches in accurately modeling the time-resolved dynamics of wildfires. We use an autoregressive process in which a convolutional recurrent deep learning model makes predictions that propagate a wildfire over 15 min increments. We apply the model to four simulated datasets of increasing complexity, containing both field fires with homogeneous fuel distribution as well as real-world topologies sampled from the California region of the United States. We show that even after 100 autoregressive predictions representing more than 24 h of simulated fire spread, the resulting models generate stable and realistic propagation dynamics, achieving a Jaccard score between 0.89 and 0.94 when predicting the resulting fire scar. The inference time of the deep learning models are examined and compared, and directions for future work are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Deep neural networks; Machine learning; Recurrent neural networks; Wildland fires,Convolution; Deep neural networks; Fires; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Topology; Fire response; Fire spread; First principles; High-fidelity modeling; Learning approach; Learning models; Machine-learning; Modelling time; Time-resolved; Wildland fire; Forecasting

The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator - INteractive Fire and Emissions algorithm for Natural envirOnments (JULES-INFERNO) is a global land surface model, which simulates vegetation, soils, and fire occurrence driven by environmental factors. However, this model incurs substantial computational costs due to the high data dimensionality and the complexity of differential equations. Deep-learning-based digital twins have an advantage in handling large amounts of data. They can reduce the computational cost of subsequent predictive models by extracting data features through reduced-order modelling (ROM) and then compressing the data to a low-dimensional latent space. This study proposes a JULES-INFERNO-based digital twin fire model using ROM techniques and deep learning prediction networks to improve the efficiency of global wildfire predictions. The iterative prediction implemented in the proposed model can use current-year data to predict fires in subsequent years. To avoid the accumulation of errors from the iterative prediction, latent data assimilation (LA) is applied to the prediction process. LA manages to efficiently adjust the prediction results to ensure the stability and sustainability of the prediction. Numerical results show that the proposed model can effectively encode the original data and achieve accurate surrogate predictions. Furthermore, the application of LA can also effectively adjust the bias of the prediction results. The proposed digital twin also runs 500 times faster for online predictions than the original JULES-INFERNO model without requiring high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.  © 2023 Caili Zhong et al.",,data assimilation; equation; forest fire; machine learning; numerical model; prediction

Fire severity data with wide spatial and temporal coverage enhances understanding of fire's impact on vegetation and improves planning to mitigate the risk of destructive wildfires. In this study, we develop a machine learning workflow that converts a spatial database of known fire events into a collection of gridded fire severity maps representing levels of canopy scorch due to wildfires and planned fuel reduction burns (prescribed burns). This workflow uses a dataset of observed fire severity interpreted from post-fire aerial images (3–7 cm spatial resolution; ~11,649 labels from 64 unique fires) to train and test a supervised classifier that predicts fire severity using 13 Landsat-derived spectral indices. For a target fire, the classifier generates a pixel-level prediction of fire severity with classes belonging to one of five ordinal categories ranging from unburnt, three levels of canopy scorch, and canopy consumed by fire. The classifier's accuracy was 84.2% (Kappa score = 0.799) and testing was undertaken across multiple fire types (wildfire / prescribed burn), seasons, forest types and topography. MODIS thermal anomalies and a MODIS-derived burn area product were used to augment the fire severity database with start- and end-of-fire dates to enable accurate delineation of pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery; this method increased model accuracy from 78.0% (Kappa = 0.72). The model was then applied to a regional 16-year (2005 to 2020) history of fire events (n fires = 713, ~1Mha) in the sclerophyll eucalypt forests and woodlands of the Northern Jarrah Forest, Western Australia. On fires with MODIS-adjusted start and end dates, high severity fire (>80% canopy scorch) was predicted more often in wildfires (67.9%, 124900 ha) compared to prescribed burns (14.6%, 110300 ha). However, the total predicted area of high-severity fire was comparable between fire types due to prescribed burns being more frequent on the landscape. We provide the first fire severity model in Western Australia that is broadly calibrated to both prescribed burns and wildfires across multiple conditions. Our model outputs are made freely available and offer opportunities to better understand the interactions between prescribed burns and wildfires, and the effects of fire severity on the environment. © 2022 The Authors",Eucalyptus; Fire severity mapping; Google earth engine; Landsat; Prescribed burn; Wildfire,Australia; Jarrah Forest; Western Australia; Western Australia; Antennas; Classification (of information); Forestry; Managers; Mapping; Radiometers; Statistical tests; Topography; Eucalypti; Fire event; Fire severity; Fire severity mapping; Google earth engine; Google earths; LANDSAT; Post-fire; Prescribed burn; Work-flows; canopy; database; environmental risk; forest management; Landsat; machine learning; mapping; MODIS; Fires

The spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of forest burn severity are closely related to its environmental drivers prior to the fire occurrence. The temperate coniferous forest of northern China is an important part of China’s forest resources and has suffered frequent forest fires in recent years. However, the understanding of environmental drivers controlling burn severity in this fire-prone region is still limited. To fill the gap, spatial pattern metrics including pre-fire fuel variables (tree canopy cover (TCC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and live fuel moisture content (LFMC)), topographic variables (elevation, slope, and topographic radiation aspect index (TRASP)), and weather variables (relative humidity, maximum air temperature, cumulative precipitation, and maximum wind speed) were correlated with a remote sensing-derived burn severity index, the composite burn index (CBI). A random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to reveal the relative importance of the environmental drivers mentioned above to burn severity for a fire. The model achieved CBI prediction accuracy with a correlation coefficient (R) equal to 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) equal to 0.16, and fitting line slope equal to 0.64. The results showed that burn severity was mostly influenced by flammable live fuels and LFMC. The elevation was the most important topographic driver, and meteorological variables had no obvious effect on burn severity. Our findings suggest that in addition to conducting strategic fuel reduction management activities, planning the landscapes with fire-resistant plants with higher LFMC when possible (e.g., “Green firebreaks”) is also indispensable for lowering the burn severity caused by wildfires in the temperate coniferous forests of northern China. © 2021 by the authors.

An accurate understanding of the interactions of meteorological variables and fire behaviour in the landscape is very complex, yet possible. In exploring such understanding, we used 2693 high-confidence active fire points recorded by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor for nine different bushfires that occurred in Victoria between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2009. These fires include the Black Saturday Bushfires of 7 February 2009, one of the worst bushfires in Australian history. For each fire point, 62 different meteorological parameters of bushfire time were extracted from Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) data. These remote sensing and meteorological datasets were fused and further processed in assessing their relative importance using four different tree-based ensemble machine learning models, namely, Random Forest (RF), Fuzzy Forest (FF), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Landsat images were used in deriving the response variable–Relative Difference Normalised Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which was selected by comparing its performance against Difference Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR). Our findings demonstrate that the FF algorithm utilising the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method has the best predictive performance of 96.50%, assessed against 10-fold cross-validation. The result shows that the relative influence of the variables on bushfire severity is in the following order: (1) soil moisture, (2) soil temperature, (3) air pressure, (4) air temperature, (5) vertical wind, and (6) relative humidity. This highlights the importance of soil meteorology in bushfire severity analysis, often excluded in bushfire severity research. Further, this study provides a scientific basis for choosing a subset of meteorological variables for bushfire severity prediction depending on their relative importance. The optimal subset of high-ranked variables is extremely useful in constructing simplified and computationally efficient surrogate models, which can be particularly useful for the rapid assessment of bushfire severity for operational bushfire management and effective mitigation efforts. © 2022 by the authors.

Annual variation in the abundance and distribution of fine-fuel present challenges to land managers implementing prescribed burns and mitigating wildfire, although methods to produce high-resolution fuel estimates are still under development. To further understand how prescribed fire and wildfire influence fine-fuels in a semi-arid grassland invaded by non-native perennial grasses, we combined high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery with in situ vegetation data and machine learning to estimate yearly fine-fuel loads from 2015 to 2020. The resulting model of fine-fuel corresponded to field-based validation measurements taken in the first (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 218 kg/ha) and last year (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 196 kg/ha) of this 6-year study. Serial prediction of the fine-fuel model allowed for an assessment of the effect of prescribed fire (average reduction of -80 kg/ha 1-year post fire) and wildfire (-260 kg/ha 1-year post fire) on fuel conditions. Post-fire fine-fuel loads were significantly lower than in unburned control areas sampled just outside fire perimeters from 2015 to 2020 across all fires (t = 1.67, p < 0.0001); however, fine-fuel recovery occurred within 3-5 years, depending upon burn and climate conditions. When coupled with detailed fuels data from field measurements, Sentinel-2A imagery provided a means for evaluating grassland fine-fuels at yearly time steps and shows high potential for extended monitoring of dryland fuels. Our approach provides land managers with a systematic analysis of the effects of fire management treatments on fine-fuel conditions and provides an accurate, updateable, and expandable solution for mapping fine-fuels over yearly time steps across drylands throughout the world.",dryland ecosystem; fuel treatment; invasive non-native grasses; Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana); post-fire recovery; Sentinel-2A,LEHMANN LOVEGRASS; SONORAN DESERT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GRASSES; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; INVASION; SAVANNA; DROUGHT

By providing detailed risk assessments, it contributes to the reduction of fire frequency and severity, safeguards forest resources, supports ecological stability, and ensures human safety. This study systematically reviews wildfire prediction literature from 2003 to 2023, emphasizing research trends and collaborative trends. Our findings reveal a significant increase in research activity between 2019 and 2023, primarily driven by the United States Forest Service and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The majority of this research was published in prominent journals such as the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Forest Ecology and Management, Remote Sensing, and Forests. These publications predominantly originate from Europe, the United States, and China. Since 2020, there has been substantial growth in the application of machine learning techniques in predicting forest fires, particularly in estimating fire occurrence probabilities, simulating fire spread, and projecting post-fire environmental impacts. Advanced algorithms, including deep learning and ensemble learning, have shown superior accuracy, suggesting promising directions for future research. Additionally, the integration of machine learning with cellular automata has markedly improved the simulation of fire behavior, enhancing both efficiency and precision. The profound impact of climate change on wildfire prediction also necessitates the inclusion of extensive climate data in predictive models. Beyond conventional studies focusing on fire behavior and occurrence probabilities, forecasting the environmental and ecological consequences of fires has become integral to forest fire management and vital for formulating more effective wildfire strategies. The study concludes that significant regional disparities in knowledge exist, underscoring the need for improved research capabilities in underrepresented areas. Moreover, there is an urgent requirement to enhance the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, such as machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning, and to intensify efforts in identifying and leveraging various wildfire drivers to refine prediction accuracy.

Due to climate change, these essential habitats are endangered by increasing wildfires. Wildfires are not just a risk to the environment, but they also pose public health risks. Given these issues, there is an indispensable need for efficient and early detection methods. Conventional detection approaches fall short due to spatial limitations and manual feature engineering, which calls for the exploration and development of data-driven deep learning solutions. This paper, in this regard, proposes 'FireXnet', a tailored deep learning model designed for improved efficiency and accuracy in wildfire detection. FireXnet is tailored to have a lightweight architecture that exhibits high accuracy with significantly less training and testing time. It contains considerably reduced trainable and non-trainable parameters, which makes it suitable for resource-constrained devices. To make the FireXnet model visually explainable and trustable, a powerful explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tool, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has been incorporated. It interprets FireXnet's decisions by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction. Furthermore, the performance of FireXnet is compared against five pre-trained models - VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2 - to benchmark its efficiency. For a fair comparison, transfer learning and fine-tuning have been applied to the aforementioned models to retrain the models on our dataset.ResultsThe test accuracy of the proposed FireXnet model is 98.42%, which is greater than all other models used for comparison. Furthermore, results of reliability parameters confirm the model's reliability, i.e., a confidence interval of [0.97, 1.00] validates the certainty of the proposed model's estimates and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.98 proves that decisions of FireXnet are in considerable accordance with the given data.ConclusionThe integration of the robust feature extraction of FireXnet with the transparency of explainable AI using SHAP enhances the model's interpretability and allows for the identification of key characteristics triggering wildfire detections. Extensive experimentation reveals that in addition to being accurate, FireXnet has reduced computational complexity due to considerably fewer training and non-training parameters and has significantly fewer training and testing times.",Wildfire; Fire detection; CNN; Transfer learning; Lightweight architecture,FLAME DETECTION; COLOR; NETWORK

Consequently, specific strategies, tactics and techniques should always be adopted for the alleviation of this critical phenomenon. Hence, the aim of the paper is the review of the most common geoinformatics-based techniques contributing to an integrated fire analysis through four pillars. The first one is related with the fire exposure on the ground, primarily analyzing the fire susceptibility in terms of fire risk and burn probability maps; The second one examines the fire effects on the most critical ecological and anthropogenic resources and infrastructures. The third pillar combines two effective geospatial tools supporting the wildfire prevention and suppression, such as the visibility analysis for early detection of fire hotspots and the network analysis for strategic and operational planning of fire events. Last, the Earth-Observation module, through the spatiotemporal monitoring and prediction of land use changes, permits the planners to evaluate the underlying pressures (fires, urbanization) against forests developing the appropriate planning guidelines. In the meantime, new perspectives emerge. Novel machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data techniques are expected to improve the fire risk/probability credibility enhancing the more precise identification of fire effects to any resource. The integration of specific geographic criteria (e.g. topography, accessibility) and programming techniques (e.g. maximizing the visible area) to visibility analysis would empower the immediate fire detection.

The ramifications of fire incidents extend widely, impacting human communities, financial resources, the natural environment, and global warming. Therefore, timely fire detection is essential for quick and effective response and not to endanger forest resources, animal life, and the human economy. This study introduces a forest fire detection approach utilizing transfer learning with the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) pretraining model and the TranSDet model, which integrates an improved deep learning algorithm. Transfer Learning based on pre-trained YoloV8 enhances a fast and accurate object detection aggregate with the TranSDet structure to detect small fires. Furthermore, to train the model, we collected 5200 images and performed augmentation techniques for data, such as rotation, scaling, and changing due and saturation. Small fires can be detected from a distance by our suggested model both during the day and at night. Objects with similarities can lead to false predictions. However, the dataset augmentation technique reduces the feasibility. The experimental results prove that our proposed model can successfully achieve 98% accuracy to minimize catastrophic incidents.

The purpose of prediction is to draw valid conclusions and provide useful advices in environmental management. Robust approach is often desirable when there exist outliers. Robust nonparametric regression methods have attracted much attention from a practical point of view. As a nonparametric Bayesian approach, Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provides a flexible regression that captures potential nonlinear relationships and complex interactions via the framework including sum-of-trees model, regularization prior and Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm (hereafter backfitting MCMC). When outliers are present in the data, we find out that BART has the highest prediction performance in simulation studies which are carried out in a variety of cases, compared to the well-known machine learning methods: random forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting.

Human intervention into the field of the destruction of nature is another cause of these forest fires. The ability to heal nature is dampened due to the expansion of human territories into forests causing loss of lands for the forests. While human expansion cannot be halted, so we as human must take a responsibility for the consequences and make sure the climatic changes due to such disasters, should be as low as possible. Halting the forest fires is an impossible task, and the best we can do control the fires and the amount of area burnt. This process can be improved by predicting the forest fires and the amount of area that might get burnt due to the predicted fire and take measures against it such that there would be no fire at all or the very least reduce the amount of area burnt during the fire.

Meanwhile, tree-based models show signs of overfitting, including gradient boosting and random forest. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis and feature importance of the Bayesian linear regression model, the number of dry days is the most important feature in predicting fire hotspots in Kalimantan. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Much of this population are increasingly adopting social media, and sites like Twitter are increasingly being used as a real-time human-sensor network during natural disasters; detecting, tracking and documenting events. The human-sensor concept is currently largely omitted by wildfire models, representing a potential loss of information. By including Twitter data as a source in our models, we aim to help disaster managers make more informed, socially driven decisions, by detecting and monitoring online social media sentiment over the course of a wildfire event. This paper implements machine learning in a wildfire prediction model, using social media and geophysical data sources with Sentiment Analysis to predict wildfire characteristics with high accuracy. We also use wildfire-specific attributes to predict online social dynamics, as this has been shown to be indicative of localised disaster severity. This may be useful for disaster management teams in identifying areas of immediate danger. We combine geophysical satellite data from the Global Fire Atlas with social data provided by Twitter. We perform data collection and subsequent analysis & visualisation, and compare regional differences in online social sentiment expression. Following this, we compare and contrast different machine learning models for predicting wildfire attributes. We demonstrate social media is a predictor of wildfire activity, and present models which accurately model wildfire attributes. This work develops the concept of the human sensor in the context of wildfires, using users’ Tweets as noisy subjective sentimental accounts of current localised conditions. This work contributes to the development of more socially conscious wildfire models, by incorporating social media data into wildfire prediction and modelling. © 2022, The Author(s).",Machine learning; Satellite data; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter data; Wildfires,

This study employs eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, particularly SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to map wildfire susceptibility in Izmir Province, T & uuml;rkiye. Incorporating fifteen conditioning factors spanning topography, climate, anthropogenic influences, and vegetation characteristics, machine learning (ML) models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) were used to predict wildfire-prone areas using freely available active fire pixel data (MODIS Active Fire Collection 6 MCD14ML product). The evaluation of the trained ML models showed that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed XGBoost and LightGBM, achieving the highest test accuracy (95.6%). All of the classifiers demonstrated a strong predictive performance, but RF excelled in sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-1 score, making it the preferred model for generating a wildfire susceptibility map and conducting a SHAP analysis. Unlike prevailing approaches focusing solely on global feature importance, this study fills a critical gap by employing a SHAP summary and dependence plots to comprehensively assess each factor's contribution, enhancing the explainability and reliability of the results. The analysis reveals clear associations between factors such as wind speed, temperature, NDVI, slope, and distance to villages with increased fire susceptibility, while rainfall and distance to streams exhibit nuanced effects. The spatial distribution of the wildfire susceptibility classes highlights critical areas, particularly in flat and coastal regions near settlements and agricultural lands, emphasizing the need for enhanced awareness and preventive measures. These insights inform targeted fire management strategies, highlighting the importance of tailored interventions like firebreaks and vegetation management. However, challenges remain, including ensuring the selected factors' adequacy across diverse regions, addressing potential biases from resampling spatially varied data, and refining the model for broader applicability.",susceptibility mapping; wildfires; XAI; GIS; MODIS data; SHAP; machine learning,PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHM; AI

Although the models demonstrated a high level of accuracy when applied to the development dataset, their performance deteriorated when evaluated against the separate evaluation dataset.

Makowski D.,"Makowski, David (6603950439)",Simple Random Forest Classification Algorithms For Predicting Occurrences And Sizes Of Wildfires,2023,Extremes,"In order to formulate effective fire-mitigation policies, it is important to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of different types of wildfires and to be able to predict their occurrence taking the main influencing factors into account. The objective of this short communication is to assess the capability of a fast and easy-to-implement random forest algorithm to estimate cumulative probabilities fire frequency and burned area using a large dataset collected in the USA. The input variables of the algorithm are voluntary restricted to climate and land use factors, which are easy to obtain in practice. No input related to fire frequency, burned area, or to any other fire characteristic is used. After model selection and training, the performance of random forest is assessed using an independent dataset including 80,000 observations of fire occurrence and burned area. Results show that the score of our simple random forest algorithm is 9% higher than the score of the winner of the data challenge of Opitz (Extreme, 2022) revealing that, although this model has a good performance, it is not the best. However, the approach proposed here can be implemented using standard packages, does not require any fire monitoring system after training, and requires little specialized knowledge in machine learning, which makes it usable by a large diversity of stakeholders. The results of this study suggest that random forest should be part of the toolbox of engineers and scientists involved in wildfire prediction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Fire; Forecast; Probability; Random forest,

In the present work, we propose relying on fire spread simulations to provide a fire danger index representative of the potential for fire spread that includes not only weather but also surrounding vegetation and orography. This is achieved using an artificial neural network emulator called DeepFire, trained based on simulated fire sizes. To determine how relevant this index can be in the assessment of next-day fire danger, the application of DeepFire to fire danger mapping using actual weather forecasts is studied. DeepFire forecasts for 13 fairly large fires that occurred in Corsica are analysed and compared with corresponding forecasts using another fire danger index used in operational conditions, highlighting the differences in terms of precision and the expected results of such predictions. The weather forecasts from which the weather inputs of DeepFire are determined have high spatial resolution and high frequency, which also applies to the fire danger predictions. Additionally, input uncertainty is propagated through DeepFire, resulting in ensembles of emulated fire size. Several approaches are proposed to analyse the results and provide fire danger maps and ratings using this new simulation-based prediction system.  © 2022 CSIRO.

Effective early prediction mechanisms are critical for minimizing these impacts. In our previous work, we developed a smart and secure wireless sensor network (WSN) utilizing physical sensors to emulate forest fire dynamics and predict fire scenarios using machine learning. Building on this foundation, this study explores the integration of virtual sensors to enhance the prediction capabilities of the WSN. Virtual sensors were generated using polynomial regression models and incorporated into a supervector framework, effectively augmenting the data from physical sensors. The enhanced dataset was used to train a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) to classify multiple fire scenarios, covering both early warning and advanced fire states. Our experimental results demonstrate that the addition of virtual sensors significantly improves the accuracy of fire scenario predictions, especially in complex situations like “Fire with Thundering” and “Fire with Thundering and Lightning”. The extended model’s ability to predict early warning scenarios such as lightning and smoke is particularly promising for proactive fire management strategies. This paper highlights the potential of combining physical and virtual sensors in WSNs to achieve superior prediction accuracy and scalability of the field without any extra cost. Such findings pave the way for deploying scalable (cost-effective), intelligent monitoring systems capable of addressing the growing challenges of forest fire prevention and management. We obtained significant results in specific scenarios based on the number of virtual sensors added, while in some scenarios, the results were less promising compared to using only physical sensors. However, the integration of virtual sensors enables coverage of much larger areas, making it a highly promising approach despite these variations. Future work includes further optimization of the virtual sensor generation process and expanding the system’s capability to handle large-scale forest environments. Moreover, utilizing virtual sensors will alleviate many challenges associated with the huge number of deployed physical sensors. © 2025 by the authors.",data augmentation; early warning systems; environmental monitoring; fire scenario classification; forest fire prediction; machine learning; smart sensing systems; supervector formation; virtual sensors; wireless sensor networks (WSN),

However, accounting for the nonlinear, spatially heterogeneous interactions between climate, vegetation, and human predictors driving the trends in fire frequency and sizes at different spatial scales remains a challenging problem for statistical fire models. Here we introduce a novel stochastic machine learning (SML) framework, SMLFire1.0, to model observed fire frequencies and sizes in 12 km × 12 km grid cells across the WUS. This framework is implemented using mixture density networks trained on a wide suite of input predictors. The modeled WUS fire frequency matches observations at both monthly (r = 0.94) and annual (r = 0.85) timescales, as do the monthly (r = 0.90) and annual (r = 0.88) area burned. Moreover, the modeled annual time series of both fire variables exhibit strong correlations (r ≥ 0:6) with observations in 16 out of 18 ecoregions. Our ML model captures the interannual variability and the distinct multidecade increases in annual area burned for both forested and non-forested ecoregions. Evaluating predictor importance with Shapley additive explanations, we find that fire-month vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is the dominant driver of fire frequencies and sizes across the WUS, followed by 1000 h dead fuel moisture (FM1000), total monthly precipitation (Prec), mean daily maximum temperature (Tmax), and fraction of grassland cover in a grid cell. Our findings serve as a promising use case of ML techniques for wildfire prediction in particular and extreme event modeling more broadly.

This study investigates the trends, patterns, and spatiotemporal distribution of FF for the period of 2001–2022, and delineates the forest fire susceptibility zones in Odisha State, India. The study utilized: (a) MODIS imagery to examine active fire point data; (b) Kernel density tools; (c) FF risk prediction using two machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF); (d) Receiver Operating Characteristic and Area Under the Curve, along with various evaluation metrics; and (e) a total of 19 factors, including three topographical, seven climatic, four biophysical, and five anthropogenic, to create a map indicating areas vulnerable to FF. The validation results revealed that the RF model achieved a precision exceeding 94 % on the validation datasets, while the SVM model reached 89 %. The estimated forest fire susceptibility zones using RF and SVM techniques indicated that 20.14 % and 16.72 % of the area, respectively, fall under the “Very High Forest Fire” susceptibility class.

This has led to extensive damage to natural resources, including forests and wildlife habitats. Effective management strategies are essential to mitigate these impacts, and this study aims to contribute to that effort through spatial prediction of forest fires in India using machine learning techniques. The research begins by analyzing spatial patterns and trends of forest fires and identifying key factors contributing to their occurrence. It then explores the relationships between forest fires and these factors. Using data from 2001 to 2020, the study develops a probability map of forest fire occurrences in India, leveraging data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on fire points and burned areas and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) land use land cover. The analysis incorporates various fire occurrence conditioning factors, including climate variables (precipitation, air temperature, specific humidity, near-surface wind speed, net longwave radiation, and land surface temperature for both daytime and nighttime), biophysical factors (aspect, slope, elevation, soil moisture, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and other factors such as proximity to railways, roads, and waterways.

Wildfire inventory data were constructed by combining the fire perimeter through field surveys and fire occurrence data gathered from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS)-Suomi thermal anomalies product between 2011 and 2020 for the Sydney area. Sixteen wildfire-related factors were acquired to assess the potential of machine learning based on support vector regression (SVR) and various metaheuristic approaches (GWO and PSO) for wildfire susceptibility mapping in Sydney. In addition, the 2019–2020 “Black Summer” fire acted as a validation dataset to assess the predictive capability of the developed model. Furthermore, the information gain ratio (IGR) method showed that driving factors such as land use, forest type, and slope degree have a large impact on wildfire susceptibility in the study area, and the frequency ratio (FR) method represented how the factors influence wildfire occurrence. Model evaluation based on area under the curve (AUC) and root average square error (RMSE) were used, and the outputs showed that the hybrid-based SVR-PSO (AUC = 0.882, RMSE = 0.006) model performed better than the standalone SVR (AUC = 0.837, RMSE = 0.097) and SVR-GWO (AUC = 0.873, RMSE = 0.080) models. Thus, optimizing SVR with metaheuristics improved the accuracy of wildfire susceptibility modeling in the study area.

Many researchers use machine learning techniques to predict forest fires by considering spatio-temporal data features. However, it is difficult to efficiently obtain the features from large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous data. There is a lack of a method that can effectively extract features required by machine learning-based forest fire predictions from multi-source spatio-temporal data. This paper proposes a forest fire prediction method that integrates spatio-temporal knowledge graphs and machine learning models. This method can fuse multi-source heterogeneous spatio-temporal forest fire data by constructing a forest fire semantic ontology and a knowledge graph-based spatio-temporal framework. This paper defines the domain expertise of forest fire analysis as the semantic rules of the knowledge graph. This paper proposes a rule-based reasoning method to obtain the corresponding data for the specific machine learning-based forest fire prediction methods, which are dedicated to tackling the problem with real-time prediction scenarios. This paper performs experiments regarding forest fire predictions based on real-world data in the experimental areas Xichang and Yanyuan in Sichuan province.

Fast-spreading wildfires endanger the safety of residents in the wildland-urban interface. To mitigate the hazards of wildfires and facilitate early evacuation, a rapid and accurate forecast of wildfire spread is critical in emergency response. This study proposes a novel dual-model deep learning approach to achieve a super real-time forecast of 2-dimensional wildfire spread in different scenarios. The first model utilizes the U-Net technique to predict the burnt area up to 5 hours in advance. The second model incorporates ConvLSTM layers to refine the forecasted results based on real-time updated input data. To evaluate the effectiveness of this methodology, we applied it to Sunshine Island, Hong Kong, and generated a numerical database consisting of 210 cases (12,600 samples) to train the deep learning models. The simulated wildfire spread database has a fine resolution of 5 m and a time step of 5 minutes. Results show that both models achieve an overall agreement of over 90% between numerical simulation and AI forecast. The real-time wildfire forecasts by AI only take a few seconds, which is 102 ~ 104 times faster than direct simulations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of AI in offering fast and high-resolution forecasts of wildfire spread, and the novel contribution is to leverage two models which can work in tandem and be utilized at various stages of wildfire management. © 2024 ISEIS All rights reserved.",artificial intelligence; fire modelling; prescribed burning; smart firefighting; wildfire prediction; wildland-urban interface,China; Hong Kong; climate change; forecasting method; machine learning; prediction; prescribed burning; real time; safety; wildfire

We propose a teleconnection-driven vision transformer (TeleViT), capable of treating the Earth as one interconnected system, integrating fine-grained local-scale inputs with global-scale inputs, such as climate indices and coarse-grained global variables.

In this study, we generated susceptibility maps of forest fire using supervised machine learning method (support vector machine-SVM) and its comparison with a versatile machine learning algorithm (random forest-RF) and their ensembles. In order to achieve this, first of all, a forest fire inventory map was constructed using Serbian historical forest fire database, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS), Landsat 8 OLI and Worldview-2 satellite images, field surveys, and interpretation of aerial photo images. A total of 126 forest fire locations were identified and randomly divided by a random selection algorithm into two groups, including training (70%) and validation data sets (30%). Forest fire susceptibility maps were prepared using SVM, RF, and their ensemble models using the training dataset and 14 selected different conditioning factors. Finally, to explore the performance of the mentioned models we used the values for area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The results depicted that the ensemble model had an AUC = 0.848, followed by the SVM model (AUC = 0.844), and RF model (AUC = 0.834). According to achieved AUC results, it can be deduced that SVM, RF, and their ensemble method had satisfactory performance.

As the wildland–urban interface expands, more people are exposed to and harmed by these extensive wildfires, which are also eroding the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems. With future wildfire activity expected to increase, there is an urgent demand for solutions that sustain healthy ecosystems and wildfire-resilient human communities. Those who manage disaster response, landscapes, and biodiversity rely on mapped projections of how fire activity may respond to climate change and other human factors. California wildfire is complex, however, and climate–fire relationships vary across the state. Given known geographical variability in drivers of fire activity, we asked whether the geographical extent of fire models used to create these projections may alter the interpretation of predictions. We compared models of fire occurrence spanning the entire state of California to models developed for individual ecoregions and then projected end-of-century future fire patterns under climate change scenarios. We trained a Maximum Entropy model with fire records and hydroclimatological variables from recent decades (1981 to 2010) as well as topographic and human infrastructure predictors. Results showed substantial variation in predictors of fire probability and mapped future projections of fire depending upon geographical extents of model boundaries.

Mitigating or eliminating the adverse effects of such fires on the service functions of urban ecosystems, while enhancing the resilience of urban greening systems in disaster prevention and risk reduction, has become a pivotal challenge in modern urban development and management. Academic focus has progressively broadened from isolated urban and forest domains to encompass the more intricate environments of the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and urban-suburban forests, with a particular emphasis on the distinctive characteristics of urban greening and in-depth research. This study employs a combination of CiteSpace bibliometric analysis and a narrative literature review to comprehensively examine three critical aspects of urban fire safety as follows: (1) the evaluation of the fire-resistant performance of landscape plants in urban green spaces; (2) the mechanisms of fire behavior in urban greening systems; and (3) the assessment and prediction of urban fire risks. Our findings indicate that landscape plants play a crucial role in controlling the spread of fires in urban green spaces by providing physical barriers and inhibiting combustion processes, thereby mitigating fire propagation. However, the diversity and non-native characteristics of urban greenery species present challenges. The existing research lacks standardized experimental indicators and often focuses on single-dimensional analyses, leading to conclusions that are limited, inconsistent, or even contradictory. Furthermore, most current fire spread models are designed primarily for forests and wildland-urban interface (WUI) regions. Empirical and semi-empirical models dominate this field, yet future advancements will likely involve coupled models that integrate climate and environmental factors. Fire risk assessment and prediction represent a global research hotspot, with machine learning- and deep learning-based approaches increasingly gaining prominence. These advanced methods have demonstrated superior accuracy compared to traditional techniques in predicting urban fire risks. This synthesis aims to elucidate the current state, trends, and deficiencies within the existing research. Future research should explore methods for screening highly resistant landscape plants, with the goal of bolstering the ecological resilience of urban greening systems and providing theoretical underpinnings for the realization of sustainable urban environmental security.",fire resistance; landscape plant; urban greening; fire spread; fire prevention and disaster reduction,FOREST-FIRE; SURFACE FIRE; FLAMMABILITY; INTERFACE; FUEL; TREE; LANDSCAPE; MORTALITY; KINETICS

As part of the research, both domestic and foreign models for the spread of forest fires were evaluated, and the key limitations of using models in real fire conditions were identified (high degree of dynamism and uncertainty of input parameters, the need to ensure minimum collection time and input parameters, as well as minimum response time of the model). Based on the data obtained, the need to use artificial neural network tools to solve the problem of predicting the forest fire's spread dynamics was substantiated. A general logic diagram of the method for forecasting the forest fire dynamics in real time has been developed, the main feature of which is the construction of a tree of convolutional neural networks.

These parameters are widely used in empirical fire forecasting tools, thus confirming that an unguided, machine learning (ML) analysis can reproduce known relationships. The simple, short time scale parameters identified can therefore provide quantifiable forecast skill for wildfires with extreme sizes. In contrast, longer aggregates of weather observations for the year prior to fire start, including specific humidity, normalized precipitation indices, average temperature, average precipitation, and vegetation indices are not strongly coupled to extreme fire size, thus afford limited or no enhanced forecast skill. The TDA demonstrates that fuel moistures and short-term weather parameters should optimize the training of ML algorithms for fire forecasting, whilst longer-term climate and ecological measures could be downweighted or omitted. The most useful short-term meteorological and fuels metrics are widely available with low latency for the conterminous U.S, and are not computationally intensive to calculate, suggesting that ML tools using these data streams may suffice to improve situational awareness for wildfire hazards in the U.S.",fire; topological data analysis; machine learning; topology; united states,ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; FIRE WEATHER; WESTERN; INSIGHTS; IMPACTS; EVENTS; TRENDS

Wildfires not only cause direct damage to human life and property but also lead to complex environmental issues, including forest ecosystem destruction and acceleration of climate change through massive greenhouse gas emissions. In South Korea, where forests cover 70% of the territory, accurate assessment and effective management of wildfire damage have emerged as critical challenges. Notably, 99.5% of domestic wildfires are small to medium fires under 100 ha, and their cumulative impact on forest ecosystems is substantial. Traditional burn severity assessment methods based on spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized burn ratio (NBR) have limitations in providing consistent evaluation criteria, as appropriate thresholds vary depending on forest types and regional characteristics. Therefore, this study developed a Transformer-based semantic segmentation model to classify burn severity into three levels: surface fire, crown scorch, and crown fire. To mitigate the class imbalance issues, we conducted experiments with three different sampling approaches for the unburned class, achieving a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.748 with the final model. Notably, the model demonstrated its practical applicability by achieving over 90% prediction accuracy in validating small wildfires under 1ha. This study presents a novel methodology for rapid and accurate estimation of burn severity using deep learning-based segmentation.

Generative adversarial networks (GAN) were used to generate synthetic data to overcome imbalances in the type of fire distribution. The results show automated ML methods applied to the binary problem to perform best of all tested methods, with an overall accuracy of 91%. TabPFN had the highest accuracy for the multi-class problem, with the use of GAN improving model fit. Results show overfitting issues with some of the ML models, highlighting the need of independent evaluation when ML models are developed. The TabPFN models have potential for application in supporting fire management, namely in fuel management and identifying situations with high fire spread and intensity potential that can impact firefighter safety. © 2023",AutoGluon; Crown fire; Generative adversarial networks; Random Forest; TabPFN; Wildfire behaviour; XGBoost,accuracy assessment; classification; coniferous forest; experimental study; fire management; machine learning

This research focuses on Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) states in central India, where forest fire risk has become particularly pronounced. The primary objectives of the study are to quantify and map the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires over the period 2001 to 2020, and to predict future fire risks using satellite derived datasets and machine learning techniques. Through a long-term analysis, the study revealed an alarming increase in the number of forest fire incidents in MP and CG. From an average of 1200 and 1000 during 2001 to 2005, the incidents increased to 2800 and 2100 during 2016 to 2020, in MP and CG respectively. To predict forest fire risk, Random Forest machine learning algorithm was adopted utilizing various satellite derived climatic, topographical, and ecological parameters such as temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, NDVI, soil moisture, litter availability, evapotranspiration and terrain parameters (at monthly scale for 20 years). While forecasting fire probability for 2018–2020, the model achieves high accuracy rate of 86.46 % in MP and 93.78 % in CG. The results highlight significant forest fire likelihood regions in the central MP and the Southern CG, identifying areas requiring enhanced fire management strategies. This study has revealed that NDVI and rainfall have played a positive role in restricting the forest fire, and their negative anomaly amplified the fire risk. The study would help forest planners and administrators to characterise vulnerable areas and prioritise their conservation provisions. © 2023 COSPAR",- Random Forest Regression; Central India; Ensemble machine learning; Forest Fire; MODIS active fire data,Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Global warming; Learning algorithms; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil moisture; - random forest regression; Active fires; Central India; Chhattisgarh; Ensemble machine learning; Fire risks; Forest fires; Machine-learning; MODIS active fire data; Random forests; Machine learning

In this setting, this study evaluates forest fire susceptibility (FFS) in northern Morocco using three geographic information system (GIS) based on machine learning algorithms: XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To this effect, a Geographic Information System (GIS) database was developed involving ten independent causal factors (elevation, aspect, slope, distance to roads, distance to residential areas, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature and wind speed) and 345 fire pixels. The 345 pixels were split into two sets for training (70%) and validation (30%) and the spatial relationships between factors affecting FFs and fire pixels was analyzed using XGB, RF, and SVM models to generate the FFS maps. The effectiveness of the models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical measures. The results of the three models hinted that XGBoost had the highest performance (AUC = 0.856), followed by RF (AUC) = 0.827), and SVM (AUC = 0.803) in the forecasting of the forest fire.

This study places its focus on wildfires in two regions of Alberta, Fort McMurray and Slave Lake, in Southwest Canada. For the simulation of wildfire spread, an adapted fire propagation model was employed, incorporating MODIS datasets such as land surface temperature, land cover, land use, and integrated climate data. The pixels were classified as burned or unburned in relation to the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire and the initial 16 days of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, utilizing defined starting points and the aforementioned specified datasets. The simulation for the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire achieved an weighted average precision, recall, and f1-scores of 0.989, 0.986, and 0.987, respectively. Additionally, macro-averaged scores across these three phases were 0.735, 0.829, and 0.774 for precision, recall, and F1-scores, respectively. The simulation of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire introduced a phased analysis, dividing the initial 16 days into three distinct periods. This approach led to average precision, recall, and f1-scores of 0.958, 0.933, and 0.942 across these phases. Additionally, macro-averaged scores across these three phases were 0.681, 0.772, and 0.710 for precision, recall, and F1-scores, respectively.

The core of WFNet is defining the spread spatiotemporal distribution field (SSDF) to describe the process of wildfire spread, enabling global optimization and end-to-end prediction. Then, a hierarchical State-Condition mechanism is implemented to progressively and efficiently encode high-order features pertaining to multimodal elements. The experimental results demonstrate that WFNet has a competitive performance to existing models in computation time and model accuracy.

Fire activity in arid, nonforested ecosystems is thought to be largely controlled by interannual variation in fuel amount, which in turn is controlled by antecedent weather. Thus, long-range forecasting of fire activity in rangelands should be feasible given annual estimates of fuel quantity. Using a 32-yr time series of spatial data, we employed machine learning algorithms to predict the relative probability of large (> 405 ha) wildfire in the Great Basin based on fine-scale annual and 16-d estimates of cover and production of vegetation functional groups, weather, and multitemporal scale drought indices. We evaluated the predictive utility of these models with a leave-1-yr-out cross-validation, building spatial hindcasts of fire probability for each year that we compared against actual footprints of large wildfires. Herbaceous aboveground biomass production, bare ground cover, and long-term drought indices were the most important predictors of burning. Across 32 fire seasons, 88% of the area burned in large wildfires coincided with the upper 3 deciles of predicted fire probabilities. At the scale of the Great Basin, several metrics of fire activity were moderately to strongly correlated with average fire probability, including total area burned in large wildfires, number of large wildfires, and maximum fire size. Our findings show that recent years of exceptional fire activity in the Great Basin were predictable based on antecedent weather-driven growth of fine fuels and reveal a significant increasing trend in fire probability over the past 3 decades driven by widespread changes in fine fuel characteristics. © 2022 The Author(s)",Cheatgrass; Drought; Fire; Fuels; Great Basin; Vegetation,Great Basin; United States; algorithm; drought; fuel; grass; hazard assessment; machine learning; prediction; smoke; vegetation dynamics; wildfire

In addition, results reveal that both models have temporal and spatial generalization capability to predict annual wildfire probability at different times and locations. Generally, the RF outperforms the LR model in almost all cases. The outputs of the models provide wildfire susceptibility maps with different levels of severity (from very high to very low).

In the past two decades, several algorithms utilizing data from Earth observation satellites have been developed to detect fire-affected areas. However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Data fusion; deep learning; remote sensing; wildfire detection,Satellites; Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Damage detection; Deep learning; Fire protection; Fires; Land surface temperature; Remote sensing; Semantics; Earth observation satellites; Fire-affected areas; Functional relationship; Learning from examples; Multisensor satellites; Multispectral instruments; Remote sensing data; Semantic segmentation; algorithm; detection method; fire management; land surface; multispectral image; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; segmentation; Sentinel; wildfire; Satellite imagery

The proposed CNN model obtains a detection accuracy greater than 80%, which greatly exceeds that of other machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and k-means clustering. Moreover, the CNN model can be trained in a relatively short period, even when employing large training datasets, and predictions can be made in just one or two minutes.

Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia that has experienced a severe number of wildfires, which have dangerous impacts on neighboring countries due to the emission of carbon and haze to the free air. The objective of this research is to map and plot the locations that consist of a significant number of fire hotspots and forecast the possible forest fire disasters in Indonesia based on the collected data of forest fires. The results of forecasting data are beneficial for the government and its policymakers to take preventive action and countermeasures regarding this wildfire issue. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, a deep learning method, was applied to analyze and then forecast the number of wildfire hotspots. The wildfire hotspot dataset from the year 2010 to 2022 is derived from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).

(57947075500)",Wildfire Likelihood In Canadian Treed Peatlands Based On Remote-sensing Time-series Of Surface Conditions,2023,Remote Sensing of Environment,"While peatland fires are less common than upland fires, long periods of moisture deficit can increase fuel availability and lead to greater fire risks in peatlands. Peatland fire likelihood is crucial as these ecosystems serve as natural fire breaks under normal hydrological conditions but can easily turn into fuel sources under drought conditions. Furthermore, peatland fires have significant implications for atmospheric pollution, releasing fine particulates, carbon, and mercury emissions. Current frameworks for estimating wildfire likelihood predominantly rely on fuel-moisture indices developed for upland environments, which cannot adequately capture the hydrological and fuel-moisture conditions specific to peatlands. Additionally, common fuel-moisture indices are reliant on station-derived meteorological data, which are scarce in remote areas and therefore imprecise over large portions of sub-Arctic Canada and the boreal forest. Remote sensing data represents a proxy for near real-time surface conditions for remote locations, such as moisture and vegetation, where a time series of remotely-sensed metrics provides information about patterns and trends in local conditions over longer periods. With this in mind, we used SAR (Sentinel-1), multispectral (Sentinel-2) and human infrastructure data as a predictor of wildfire probability in treed peatlands of Canada. We developed a fire probability model based on metrics drawn from a seasonally decomposed time series of SAR backscatter and common multispectral indices of greenness, soil moisture and vegetation moisture. Sample sites were derived from an existing treed peatland map, then the Canadian Forest Service National Burned Area Composite dataset was used to identify fire events within those areas. This study presents a robust and versatile framework for training fire probability models that leverage remote sensing data and temporally-invariant ancillary predictors. Fire probability in peatland locations, given current conditions, was predicted through a model algorithm called extreme gradient boosting. To obtain fire probabilities over a four-week timeframe, the output of the binary classifier was calibrated, transforming its raw scores into more accurate probabilities. This approach showcases the effectiveness of machine learning methods in harnessing seasonally-decomposed remotely sensed time-series to improve fire prediction. The most important predictors of fire likelihood in treed peatlands were found to be multispectral moisture-related indices (Tasseled cap Wetness and Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and the distance to human infrastructure, which may indicate an overrepresentation of human-caused fires in the predictions. Using subsets of predictors, different iterations of the model demonstrate that incorporating SAR backscatter data can enhance the accuracy of fire likelihood predictions. However, models relying solely on SAR data exhibited lower performance, indicating limited applicability of SAR backscatter in treed peatlands without more advanced filtering and a correction method. The fire likelihood model presented here adds seasonally-detrended time series metrics from remote sensing observations to inform fire risk, independent from meteorological data. Such models could be implemented for a near-real time assessment of fire conditions that could complement the existing framework for fire risk predictions in Canada. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",,Canada; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Time series; Vegetation mapping; Wetlands; %moisture; 'current; Fire risks; Fuel moisture; Moisture index; Peat land; Remote-sensing; SAR backscatter; Surface conditions; Times series; algorithm; data set; drought; machine learning; peatland; remote sensing; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; vegetation dynamics; Fires

The time series and spatial dispersion of wildfires have been studied by some scholars. Wildfire samples were acquired in a monthly series for the Montesinho Natural Park historical fire site dataset (January 2000 to December 2003), which can be used to assess the possible effects of geographical and temporal variations on forest fires. Based on the above dataset, dynamic wildfire distribution thresholds were examined using a K-means++ clustering technique for each subgroup, and monthly series data were categorized as flammable or non-flammable depending on the thresholds. A five-fold hierarchical cross-validation strategy was used to train four machine learning models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). Finally, to explore the performance of those we have mentioned, we used accuracy (ACC), F1 score (F1), and the values for the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). The results depicted that the XGBoost model works best under the evaluation of the three metrics (ACC = 0.8132, F1 = 0.7862, and AUC = 0.8052). The model performance is significantly improved when compared to the approach of classifying wildfires by burned area size (ACC = 72.3%), demonstrating that spatiotemporal heterogeneity has a broad influence on wildfire occurrence.

A Deep Learning Approach With Synthetic Data,2024,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,"Forests play a crucial role as the lungs and life-support system of our planet, harbouring 80% of the Earth 's biodiversity. However, we are witnessing an average loss of 480 ha of forest every hour because of destructive wildfires spreading across the globe. To effectively mitigate the threat of wildfires, it is crucial to devise precise and dependable approaches for forecasting fire dynamics and formulating efficient fire management strategies, such as the utilisation of fuel models. The objective of this study was to enhance forest fuel classification that considers only structural information, such as the Prometheus model, by integrating data on the fire responses of various tree species and other vegetation elements, such as ground litter and shrubs. This distinction can be achieved using multispectral (MS) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in mixed forests. The methodology involves a novel approach in semantic classifications of forests by generating synthetic data with semantic labels regarding fire responses and reflectance information at different spectral bands, as a real MS scanner device would detect. Forests, which are highly intricate environments, present challenges in accurately classifying point clouds. To address this complexity, a deep learning (DL) model for semantic classification was trained on synthetic point clouds in different formats to achieve the best performance when leveraging MS data. Forest plots in the study region were scanned using different Terrestrial Laser Scanning sensors at wavelengths of 905 and 1550 nm. Subsequently, an interpolation process was applied to generate the MS point clouds of each plot, and the trained DL model was applied to classify them. These classifications surpassed the average thresholds of 90% and 75% for accuracy and intersection over union, respectively, resulting in a more precise categorisation of fuel models based on the distinct responses of forest elements to fire. The results of this study reveal the potential of MS LiDAR data and DL classification models for improving fuel model retrieval in forest ecosystems and enhancing wildfire management efforts.",Multispectral LiDAR; Deep learning; Fire response; Synthetic data; Wildfire,FIRE; CLASSIFICATION; AIRBORNE; GENERATION; MODELS; PINUS; TREES; MAPS

Nevertheless, the reliability of such ML approaches is heavily contingent on the integrity of data and the robustness of training protocols. The scientific community has raised concerns about the transparency and interpretability of ML models in the context of wildfire management, recognizing the need for these models to be both accurate and understandable. The often-opaque nature of complex ML algorithms can obscure the rationale behind their outputs, making it imperative to prioritize clarity and interpretability to ensure that model predictions are not only precise but also actionable. Furthermore, a thorough evaluation of model performance must account for multiple critical factors to ensure the utility and dependability of the results in practical wildfire suppression and management strategies.ResultsThis study unveils a sophisticated spatial deep learning framework grounded in TabNet technology, tailored specifically for delineating areas susceptible to wildfires.

The findings of this study accentuate the criticality of transparency in modeling, which facilitates a deeper understanding of wildfire risk factors.

On a small scale, it is possible to ensure constant monitoring of the natural landscape through ground means. However, on the scale of large countries, this becomes practically impossible due to remote and vast forest territories. The most promising source of data in this case that can provide global monitoring is remote sensing data. Currently, the main challenge is the development of an effective pipeline that combines geospatial data collection and the application of advanced machine learning algorithms. Most approaches focus on short-term fire spreading prediction and utilize data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for this purpose. In this study, we address the challenge of predicting fire spread on a large scale and consider a forecasting horizon ranging from 1 to 5 days. We train a neural network model based on the MA-Net architecture to predict wildfire spread based on environmental and climate data, taking into account spatial distribution features. Estimating the importance of features is another critical issue in fire behavior prediction, so we analyze their contribution to the model’s results. According to the experimental results, the most significant features are wind direction and land cover parameters. The F1-score for the predicted burned area varies from 0.64 to 0.68 depending on the day of prediction (from 1 to 5 days).

Wildfire susceptibility mapping is an essential technique for assessing areas prone to wildfires. In this study, we proposed the combination of the damage proxy map (DPM) and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) method to generate a precise wildfire inventory map and used it to predict areas susceptible to wildfire. The wildfire susceptibility maps were produced using frequency ratio (FR), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep learning and their performances were compared. We implemented the proposed method on Maui Island, Hawaii, where wildfires frequently occur. We started the process by generating a wildfire inventory map from 2019 to 2023 based on the DPM method applied to Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data combined with a dNBR map retrieved from Sentinel-2 data. The wildfire inventory was randomly divided into a training dataset (70%) and a testing dataset (30%). Fifteen wildfire-related factors, including topographical, meteorological, land use, environmental, and anthropological factors, were selected to predict wildfires. The wildfire-related factors were selected by conducting study literature and considering spatial correlation analysis based on the FR method, information gain ratio analysis (IGR), and multicollinearity assessment using tolerance (TOL) and variance inflation factor (VIF) metrics. The level of susceptibility of an area to wildfire is divided into five, namely very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. The FR, CNN, and LSTM produced wildfire susceptibility maps with similar patterns, significantly influenced by land use and rainfall factors. The highly susceptible areas are located on gentle slopes covered by agricultural land and unhealthy vegetation, and these areas have low rainfall intensity but receive high levels of solar radiation. Meanwhile, areas with relatively low susceptibility occur in forests with high levels of wet canopy evaporation. The prediction results were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and the CNN performed slightly better than the FR and LSTM, with AUC values of 0.879, 0.877, and 0.870, respectively. Hence, the use of the CNN algorithm in the proposed method is appropriate, specifically for the study area. In addition, the susceptibility map provides information on susceptible areas on Maui Island, Hawaii, to increase public awareness.",Wildfire susceptibility map; Maui Island; damage proxy map (DPM); differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR); deep learning,CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; DECISION TREE; FOREST; VALIDATION

Comparison Of Statistical Driven Partitioning And Machine Learning Approach,2018,ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH 2018,"The identification of areas most vulnerable to fire risk is a key tool in wildfire management, particularly in view of the limited availability of fire risk management resources, most of which are used for national and regional air services. The few resources available can thus be used on a yearly basis to mitigate problems in the areas at highest risk by defining a program of interventions. In this contest, the main objective of the present study is to elaborate wildfire susceptibility mapping for Liguria region (Italy), and to compare results obtained by a statistical driven partitioning models with the ones obtaining by appling a machine learnig approach, based on Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The availability of a mapping of fire perimeters spans almost 20 years (1996-2016), and this, combined with a detailed knowledge of topography, climate and land cover, allowed to understand the main features involved in wildfire occurrences and their behavior. The seasonality of the fire regime was also considered, partitioning the analysis in two macro season (November-April and May- October). The analysis was based on a recursive-quantiles subdivision of the territory in classes based on the different available information layers: elevation, slope, aspect, rainfall height, temperature (the latter subdivided in winter and summer periods). The algorithm was designed in order to assure the equal representation of each class, in which the number of fires occurred in the period of analysis is considered, in order to have an estimation of the fire hazard with a constant statistical confidence. The resulting wildfire susceptibility map was then compared with the map obtained applying a machine learning (ML) approach. ML explores the conception of algorithms capable of learning from and make predictions on data, through the modeling of the hidden relationships between a set of input and output variables (i.e. the predisposing factors and the occurrence of the phenomenon). The main benefit is that these approaches are data driven, meaning that they do not need a priori knowledge of the process. Moreover, RF directly provides the measurement of the importance of each variable. The results show that both the approaches identify shrubs as the vegetation most affected by wildfire both in summer and winter season. RF algorithm seems to perform better, detecting 90% of the of the BA within 10% of the entire territory instead of 60% of burned area within the 20% of the territory for the statistical driven partitioning. These results are preliminary and need to be further evaluated in detail by establishing a working plan accounting for a common validation dataset for the two approaches.",Wildfire susceptibility mapping; Machine learning; Random Forest; Statistical partitioning; forest management plan,FOREST-FIRE; RISK; GIS

Applications connected to the prediction, management, and recognition of wildfires are enhanced recently. But, with utilize of technical solutions including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and wireless sensor networks (WSN), it can be feasible for developing early-warning methods with appropriate accuracy. With important sensors to measure variations in wind speed, temperature, and humidity, as well as for detecting the occurrence of fire and smoke, is a suitable manner for accomplishing this task, based on our view. Imaging sensors in WSN are utilized for collecting data in the target environment and deep learning (DL) approaches for forest fire detection (FFD) observe the attained images. With this motivation, this study develops a new DL model for forest fire detection named, the FFDNet technique. The presented FFDNet technique uses an emperor penguin optimizer with machine learning for forest fire detection in WSN. The goal of the FFDNet technique is to identify the occurrence of forest wire using sensors in WSN and DL models. Primarily, the sensor nodes transmit the images to the BS where the actual classification process takes place. In the presented FFDNet technique, the guided filtering (GF) technique is employed for the noise removal process. Besides, the presented FFDNet technique exploits a modified Xception network for a feature extraction process with root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. For the detection process, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) model is used in this study and the EPO algorithm can optimally choose its parameters. A wide range of experiments was performed by the FFDNet technique and the results are examined under diverse aspects. The simulation results reported the enhancements of the FFDNet technique over other DL models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Computer vision; Deep learning; Forest fire detection; Machine learning; Wireless sensor networks,Computer vision; Deep learning; Deforestation; Fire detectors; Fire hazards; Internet of things; Learning systems; Sensor nodes; Smoke; Wind; Deep learning; Economic damages; Environmental damage; Forest fire detection; Forest fires; Learning models; Machine-learning; Optimizers; Technical solutions; Vision model; Fires
