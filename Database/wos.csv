Classical wildfire spread models have relied on mathematical and empirical approaches, which have trouble capturing the complexity of fire dynamics and suffer from poor flexibility and static assumptions. The emergence of machine learning (ML) and, more specifically, deep learning (DL) has introduced new techniques that significantly enhance prediction accuracy. ML models, such as support vector machines and ensemble models, use tabular data points to identify patterns and predict fire behavior. However, these models often struggle with the dynamic nature of wildfires. In contrast, DL approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and convolutional recurrent networks (CRNs), excel at handling the spatiotemporal complexities of wildfire data. CNNs are particularly effective at analyzing spatial data from satellite imagery, while CRNs are suited for both spatial and sequential data, making them highly performant in predicting fire behavior. This paper presents a systematic review of recent ML and DL techniques developed for wildfire spread prediction, detailing the commonly used datasets, the improvements achieved, and the limitations of current methods. It also outlines future research directions to address these challenges, emphasizing the potential for DL to play an important role in wildfire management and mitigation strategies.","[Andrianarivony, Henintsoa S.; Akhloufi, Moulay A.] Univ Moncton, Percept Robot & Intelligent Machines PRIME, Dept Comp Sci, Moncton, NB E1A3E9, Canada",,"Akhloufi, MA (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Percept Robot & Intelligent Machines PRIME, Dept Comp Sci, Moncton, NB E1A3E9, Canada.",eha6818@umoncton.ca; moulay.akhloufi@umoncton.ca,,,,,,,83,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2024,7,12,,,,,,,482,10.3390/fire7120482,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001384334700001,0,machine learning and deep learning for wildfire spread prediction: a review

In current times, there has been a lot of interest in machine learning techniques. The machine learning methods that are used to identify and forecast forest fires are reviewed in this article. Selecting the best forecasting model is a constant gamble because each ML algorithm has advantages and disadvantages.

Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods - including deep learning and agent-based learning - in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire research and management communities play an active role in providing relevant, high-quality, and freely available wildfire data for use by practitioners of ML methods.","[Jain, Piyush] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Northern Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; [Jain, Piyush; Coogan, Sean C.

Fire danger indexes, such as the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), measure the potential wildfire danger at a given time and location. Thus, by predicting these fire danger indexes in advance, power system operators can obtain valuable insight into the potential wildfire risks and can better be prepared to tackle the wildfires. However, due to dependency on weather conditions, these indexes usually have volatile time series, which make their prediction complex. Taking these facts into account, this paper, unlike previous approaches that predict fire danger indexes based on climatological models, develops a machine learning-based forecast process to predict these indexes using the relevant weather data and past performance. To do this, first, a volatility analysis approach is presented to analyse the volatility level of the time series data of a fire danger index. Afterwards, an effective machine learning-based forecast methodology using a new deep feature selection model is proposed to predict fire danger indexes. The developed forecast methodology is tested on the real-world data of FFDI and FWI and is compared with several popular alternative methods reported in the literature.","[Pham, Tan Nhat; Shah, Rakibuzzaman; Amjady, Nima; Islam, Syed] Federat Univ Australia, Ctr New Energy Transit Res CfNETR, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia",,"Shah, R (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Ctr New Energy Transit Res CfNETR, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia.",m.shah@federation.edu.au,,,,,,,73,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2024,18,23,,,,,4008,4022,,10.1049/gtd2.13320,0,,nov-24,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,Engineering,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001354212100001,0,prediction of fire danger index using a new machine learning based method to enhance power system resiliency against wildfires

However, we are witnessing an average loss of 480 ha of forest every hour because of destructive wildfires spreading across the globe. To effectively mitigate the threat of wildfires, it is crucial to devise precise and dependable approaches for forecasting fire dynamics and formulating efficient fire management strategies, such as the utilisation of fuel models. The objective of this study was to enhance forest fuel classification that considers only structural information, such as the Prometheus model, by integrating data on the fire responses of various tree species and other vegetation elements, such as ground litter and shrubs. This distinction can be achieved using multispectral (MS) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in mixed forests. The methodology involves a novel approach in semantic classifications of forests by generating synthetic data with semantic labels regarding fire responses and reflectance information at different spectral bands, as a real MS scanner device would detect. Forests, which are highly intricate environments, present challenges in accurately classifying point clouds. To address this complexity, a deep learning (DL) model for semantic classification was trained on synthetic point clouds in different formats to achieve the best performance when leveraging MS data. Forest plots in the study region were scanned using different Terrestrial Laser Scanning sensors at wavelengths of 905 and 1550 nm. Subsequently, an interpolation process was applied to generate the MS point clouds of each plot, and the trained DL model was applied to classify them. These classifications surpassed the average thresholds of 90% and 75% for accuracy and intersection over union, respectively, resulting in a more precise categorisation of fuel models based on the distinct responses of forest elements to fire. The results of this study reveal the potential of MS LiDAR data and DL classification models for improving fuel model retrieval in forest ecosystems and enhancing wildfire management efforts.","[Comesana-Cebral, Lino; Martinez-Sanchez, Joaquin; Suarez-Fernandez, Gabriel; Arias, Pedro] Univ Vigo, CINTECX, Appl Geotechnol Grp, Vigo 36310, Spain",,"Comesaña-Cebral, L (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, CINTECX, Appl Geotechnol Grp, Vigo 36310, Spain.",linojose.comesana@uvigo.gal,,,,,,,67,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2024,81,,,,,,,,102612,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102612,0,,APR 2024,,Ecology,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001220889700001,0,wildfire response of forest species from multispectral lidar data. a deep learning approach with synthetic data

By providing detailed risk assessments, it contributes to the reduction of fire frequency and severity, safeguards forest resources, supports ecological stability, and ensures human safety. This study systematically reviews wildfire prediction literature from 2003 to 2023, emphasizing research trends and collaborative trends. Our findings reveal a significant increase in research activity between 2019 and 2023, primarily driven by the United States Forest Service and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The majority of this research was published in prominent journals such as the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Forest Ecology and Management, Remote Sensing, and Forests. These publications predominantly originate from Europe, the United States, and China. Since 2020, there has been substantial growth in the application of machine learning techniques in predicting forest fires, particularly in estimating fire occurrence probabilities, simulating fire spread, and projecting post-fire environmental impacts. Advanced algorithms, including deep learning and ensemble learning, have shown superior accuracy, suggesting promising directions for future research. Additionally, the integration of machine learning with cellular automata has markedly improved the simulation of fire behavior, enhancing both efficiency and precision. The profound impact of climate change on wildfire prediction also necessitates the inclusion of extensive climate data in predictive models. Beyond conventional studies focusing on fire behavior and occurrence probabilities, forecasting the environmental and ecological consequences of fires has become integral to forest fire management and vital for formulating more effective wildfire strategies. The study concludes that significant regional disparities in knowledge exist, underscoring the need for improved research capabilities in underrepresented areas. Moreover, there is an urgent requirement to enhance the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, such as machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning, and to intensify efforts in identifying and leveraging various wildfire drivers to refine prediction accuracy. The insights generated from this field will profoundly augment our understanding of wildfire prediction, assisting policymakers and practitioners in managing forest resources more sustainably and averting future wildfire calamities.","[Bao, Mingwei; Liu, Jiahao; Ren, Hong; Liu, Suting; Liu, Jianxiang] Southwest Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Kunming 650224, Peoples R China; [Ren, Caixia; Chen, Chen] Southwest Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Kunming 650224, Peoples R China",,"Liu, JX (corresponding author), Southwest Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Kunming 650224, Peoples R China.",baomingwei924@126.com; lj17630528656@outlook.com; renhong0308@163.com; rsyy1018486972@163.com; rencx107@163.com; chenchen3462@163.com; liujxswfu@163.com,,,,,,,98,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2024,15,7,,,,,,,1197,10.3390/f15071197,0,,,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001277503900001,0,research trends in wildland fire prediction amidst climate change: a comprehensive bibliometric analysis

In addition, results reveal that both models have temporal and spatial generalization capability to predict annual wildfire probability at different times and locations. Generally, the RF outperforms the LR model in almost all cases. The outputs of the models provide wildfire susceptibility maps with different levels of severity (from very high to very low).

The few resources available can thus be used on a yearly basis to mitigate problems in the areas at highest risk by defining a program of interventions. In this contest, the main objective of the present study is to elaborate wildfire susceptibility mapping for Liguria region (Italy), and to compare results obtained by a statistical driven partitioning models with the ones obtaining by appling a machine learnig approach, based on Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The availability of a mapping of fire perimeters spans almost 20 years (1996-2016), and this, combined with a detailed knowledge of topography, climate and land cover, allowed to understand the main features involved in wildfire occurrences and their behavior. The seasonality of the fire regime was also considered, partitioning the analysis in two macro season (November-April and May- October). The analysis was based on a recursive-quantiles subdivision of the territory in classes based on the different available information layers: elevation, slope, aspect, rainfall height, temperature (the latter subdivided in winter and summer periods). The algorithm was designed in order to assure the equal representation of each class, in which the number of fires occurred in the period of analysis is considered, in order to have an estimation of the fire hazard with a constant statistical confidence. The resulting wildfire susceptibility map was then compared with the map obtained applying a machine learning (ML) approach. ML explores the conception of algorithms capable of learning from and make predictions on data, through the modeling of the hidden relationships between a set of input and output variables (i.e. the predisposing factors and the occurrence of the phenomenon). The main benefit is that these approaches are data driven, meaning that they do not need a priori knowledge of the process. Moreover, RF directly provides the measurement of the importance of each variable.

However, current land-surface models are limited in their representation of fire processes, including their ignition and spread. This study thus developed FireDL, a novel data-driven machine-learning model for the prediction of natural wildfires, and combined it with a land-surface model to better understand the impact of fire on carbon fluxes. FireDL has a two-stage deep learning structure that sequentially combines a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN). Preliminary random forest analysis identified fire duration as an important factor in predicting the burned area. Thus, in FireDL, the LSTM algorithm was employed to predict fire occurrence and duration, utilizing lightning, vegetation, and climate datasets. Subsequently, the ANN predicted the total burned area using the LTSM-derived fire duration predictions and climate datasets as input. FireDL produced a robust performance in predicting large fires (>10 000 ha), achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.72. The daily-scaled burned area predictions derived from FireDL were integrated into the Community Land Model version 5-Biogeochemistry (CLM5-BGC) to produce CLM5-BGC-FireDL. This integration considerably improved carbon emission estimations. Notably, the total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimated using CLM5-BGC-FireDL in 2019, the year with the highest recorded burned area during our study, was twice that estimated using the standard CLM5-BGC. Discrepancies in the NEE can significantly influence atmospheric CO(2 )levels, highlighting the importance of our fire prediction model in forecasting the burned area and carbon emissions. The use of FireDL with future climate scenarios is thus anticipated to yield valuable insights into ecosystem management and climate change","[Seo, Hocheol; Kim, Yeonjoo] Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul, South Korea",,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",yeonjoo.kim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1,2024,19,12,,,,,,,124040,10.1088/1748-9326/ad8bdc,0,,,,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001353754700001,0,enhancing alaskan wildfire prediction and carbon flux estimation: a two-stage deep learning approach within a process-based model

In general, forest fire incidences bring significant negative impact to the economy, environment, and society. One of the crucial mitigation actions that needs to be readied is an effective forest fire detection system that are able to automatically notify the relevant parties on the incidence of forest fire as early as possible. This review paper has examined in details 37 research articles that have implemented deep learning (DL) model for forest fire detection, which were published between January 2018 and 2023. In this paper, in depth analysis has been performed to identify the quantity and type of data that includes images and video datasets, as well as data augmentation methods and the deep model architecture. This paper is structured into five subsections, each of which focuses on a specific application of deep learning (DL) in the context of forest fire detection. These subsections include 1) classification, 2) detection, 3) detection and classification, 4) segmentation, and 5) segmentation and classification. To compare the model's performance, the methods were evaluated using comprehensive metrics like accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), F1-Score, mean pixel accuracy (MPA), etc. From the findings, of the usage of DL models for forest fire surveillance systems have yielded favourable outcomes, whereby the majority of studies managed to achieve accuracy rates that exceeds 90%. To further enhance the efficacy of these models, future research can explore the optimal fine-tuning of the hyper-parameters, integrate various satellite data, implement generative data augmentation techniques, and refine the DL model architecture.

In this study, we use the Random Forest machine learning method to map the wildfire susceptibility of Irkutsk Oblast based on data from remote sensing, meteorology, government forestry authorities, and emergency situations. The main contributions of the paper are the following: an improved domain model that describes information about weather conditions, vegetation type, and infrastructure of the region in the context of the possible risk of wildfires; a database of wildfires in Irkutsk Oblast from 2017 to 2020; the results of an analysis of factors that cause wildfires and risk assessment based on Random Forest in the form of fire hazard mapping. In this paper, we collected and visualized data on wildfires and factors influencing their occurrence: meteorological, topographic, characteristics of vegetation, and human activity (social factors). Data sets describing two classes, '' fire '' and '' no fire '', were generated. We introduced a classification according to which the probability of a wildfire in each specific cell of the territory can be determined and a wildfire risk map built. The use of the Random Forest method allowed us to achieve the following risk assessment accuracy indicators: accuracy-0.89, F1-score-0.88, and AUC-0.96.

North-East India (NEI) experiences high incidences of forest fires, making it crucial to implement suitable management measures considering the driving forces influencing fire likelihood. This study aims to identify forest fire susceptibility zones in NEI by using five machine-learning modeling approaches, Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and an ensemble method. Forest fire data from the SNPP - VIIRS sensor (2018-2019) were rectified for spatial autocorrelation. Thirty-two responsive predictor variables related to topographic, climatic, biophysical, and anthropogenic factors were used as model inputs and multicollinearity analysis was performed to eliminate highly correlated predictors. Results indicate that the southern and southeastern regions of NEI, characterized by ample solar radiation, enhanced vegetation index, high human population density, and jhum cultivation, contribute significantly to higher susceptibility to forest fires. The Random Forest model performs best among the models employed, achieving an AUC value of 0.87. The ensemble susceptibility map, binarized based on AUC weighting, covers 29.54% of the total geographic area and 44.42% of the forested area of NEI. The vulnerability levels vary among states, with Mizoram showing the highest susceptibility at 89.27% and Sikkim exhibiting the lowest vulnerability at only 0.49% of their respective geographic areas. This map provides valuable insights for implementing effective forest fire management plans in the region. Moreover, the methodology utilized in this study, which incorporates satellite imagery, GIS techniques, and improved modeling techniques, can be replicated in any geographical region worldwide to facilitate effective forest fire management at a regional to large scale.","[Sarkar, Mriganka Shekhar; Majhi, Bishal Kumar; Pathak, Bhawna; Biswas, Tridipa; Mahapatra, Soumik; Kumar, Devendra] Govind Ballabh Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm N, North East Reg Ctr, Itanagar 791113, Arunachal Prade, India; [Bhatt, Indra D.; Kuniyal, Jagadish C.; Nautiyal, Sunil] Govind Ballabh Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm N, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India",,"Sarkar, MS (corresponding author), Govind Ballabh Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm N, North East Reg Ctr, Itanagar 791113, Arunachal Prade, India.",mriganka.bio@gmail.com,,,,,,,123,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2024,81,,,,,,,,102598,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102598,0,,APR 2024,,Ecology,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001293691100001,0,ensembling machine learning models to identify forest fire-susceptible zones in northeast india

As part of the research, both domestic and foreign models for the spread of forest fires were evaluated, and the key limitations of using models in real fire conditions were identified (high degree of dynamism and uncertainty of input parameters, the need to ensure minimum collection time and input parameters, as well as minimum response time of the model). Based on the data obtained, the need to use artificial neural network tools to solve the problem of predicting the forest fire's spread dynamics was substantiated.

To evaluate public health impacts of wildfire smoke, we integrated numerical simulations and observations for regional fire events during August-September of 2017. A one-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting and Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system was used to simulate fire smoke transport and dispersion. To reduce modeling bias in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and to optimize smoke exposure estimates, we integrated modeling results with the high-resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction satellite aerosol optical depth and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency AirNow ground-level monitoring PM2.5 concentrations. Three machine learning-based data fusion algorithms were applied: An ordinary multi-linear regression method, a generalized boosting method, and a random forest (RF) method. 10-Fold cross-validation found improved surface PM2.5 estimation after data integration and bias correction, especially with the RF method. Lastly, to assess transient health effects of fire smoke, we applied the optimized high-resolution PM2.5 exposure estimate in a short-term exposure-response function. Total estimated regional mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure during the smoke episode was 183 (95% confidence interval: 0, 432), with 85% of the PM2.5 pollution and 95% of the consequent multiple-cause mortality contributed by fire emissions. This application demonstrates both the profound health impacts of fire smoke over the PNW and the need for a high-performance fire smoke forecasting and reanalysis system to reduce public health risks of smoke hazards in fire-prone regions.","[Zou, Yufei; Alvarado, Ernesto C.; Solomon, Robert] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [O'Neill, Susan M.; Larkin, Narasimhan K.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Wildland Fire Sci Lab, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Mass, Clifford] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Liu, Yang] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Odman, M.

However, robust simulations of crown fire behavior are still challenging, limiting the accuracy of regional-scale CFP mapping. This study aims to incorporate fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to improve CFP mapping at a regional scale. First, we built a crown fire dataset using the fire simulations from the FARSITE model, as well as multi-source data, including fuel, weather, and topography variables. Fuel model parameters were optimized with four metaheuristic algorithms for robust fire simulations. Then, the hybrid models of CFP estimation (TBA-ML) were established by coupling with the transfer AdaBoost (TrAdaBoost) algorithm and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., Bayesian Network (BN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to estimate CFP for crown fire danger assessment spatially. Results showed that the TBA-BN model performed best in estimating CFP with higher accuracy (AUC>0.9 and F1 score > 0.8) than the RF- and SVMbased CFP models. The variable importance and causal analysis showed that fuel and topography variables have major contributions to crown fire occurrence. Finally, we mapped monthly average passive and active CFP at regional scales and qualitatively demonstrated that our CFP time-series products successfully captured the dynamic change of crown fire danger. The above results suggest the potential of integrating fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to accurately estimate CFP to improve crown fire management.","[Chen, Rui; He, Binbin; Li, Yanxi; Zhang, Yiru; Liao, Zhanmang; Fan, Chunquan; Yin, Jianpeng; Zhang, Hongguo] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China",,"He, BB (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.",binbinhe@uestc.edu.cn,,,,,,,74,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2024,132,,,,,,,,104080,10.1016/j.jag.2024.104080,0,,AUG 2024,,Remote Sensing,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001293022600001,0,"incorporating fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to estimate crown fire potential for pine forests in sichuan, china"

This study integrated multiple factors, including topography, climate, vegetation, and human activities, and employed machine learning models, specifically random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN), to predict forest fire occurrence in Jiangxi. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer L3 fire-point data from 2001-2020, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires and applied the weight of evidence (WoE) method to evaluate the correlation between forest fires and environmental factors. WoE was employed to select negative samples, which were compared with those obtained using traditional random sampling methods. The optimal model was then utilized to generate seasonal spatial distribution maps of forest fire risk throughout Jiangxi Province. The results showed that over the past two decades, the frequency of forest fires generally decreased. RF demonstrated a significant advantage over SVM and BPNN in predicting forest fires. Vegetation coverage was the most influential factor. In addition, the models trained with WoE-selected negative samples exhibited enhanced accuracy, with area under the curve values increasing from 0.946 to 0.995 for RF, 0.8344 to 0.925 for SVM, and 0.832 to 0.850 for BPNN, compared to those trained with randomly sampled negative data. Finally, forest fires were most frequent during winter, particularly in Ganzhou, Fuzhou, and Ji'an. High-risk fire zones were more dispersed in spring, whereas autumn fires were primarily concentrated in Ganzhou, and fire activity was relatively low during summer. The seasonal forest fire risk maps generated in this study offer valuable insights for guiding forest fire management in the Jiangxi Province and similar regions, providing critical practical significance for informed decision-making.","[Lu, Jinping; Li, Mangen; Qin, Yaozu; Chen, Niannan; Wang, Lili; Yang, Wanzhen; Song, Yuke; Zheng, Yisu] East China Univ Technol, Sch Earth Sci, Nanchang 330032, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",,"Li, MG (corresponding author), East China Univ Technol, Sch Earth Sci, Nanchang 330032, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",75363159@qq.com,,,,,,,76,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1,2024,6,12,,,,,,,125020,10.1088/2515-7620/ad9cf2,0,,,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001380806400001,0,a study on forest fire risk assessment in jiangxi province based on machine learning and geostatistics

To this effect, a Geographic Information System (GIS) database was developed involving ten independent causal factors (elevation, aspect, slope, distance to roads, distance to residential areas, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature and wind speed) and 345 fire pixels. The 345 pixels were split into two sets for training (70%) and validation (30%) and the spatial relationships between factors affecting FFs and fire pixels was analyzed using XGB, RF, and SVM models to generate the FFS maps. The effectiveness of the models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical measures. The results of the three models hinted that XGBoost had the highest performance (AUC = 0.856), followed by RF (AUC) = 0.827), and SVM (AUC = 0.803) in the forecasting of the forest fire.

Since this has a significant impact on various sectors of our life, recent works are concerned with identifying and predicting such extreme events from Earth observations. With respect to wildfire danger forecasting, previous deep learning approaches duplicate static variables along the time dimension and neglect the intrinsic differences between static and dynamic variables. Furthermore, most existing multibranch architectures lose the interconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. To address these issues, this article proposes a 2-D/3-D two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) with a location-aware adaptive normalization (LOAN) layer. Using LOAN as a building block, we can modulate the dynamic features conditional on their geographical locations. Thus, our approach considers feature properties as a unified yet compound 2-D/3-D model. Besides, we propose using the sinusoidal-based encoding of the day of the year to provide the model with explicit temporal information about the target day within the year. Our experimental results show a better performance of our approach than other baselines on the challenging FireCube dataset. The results show that location-aware adaptive feature normalization is a promising technique to learn the relation between dynamic variables and their geographic locations, which is highly relevant for areas where remote sensing data build the basis for analysis.

It takes a lot of effort and long time to restore areas damaged by wildfires. Therefore, it is crucial to know the forest fire risk of a region to appropriately prepare and respond to such disastrous events. The purpose of this study is to develop an hourly forest fire risk index (HFRI) with 1 km spatial resolution using accessibility, fuel, time, and weather factors based on Catboost machine learning over South Korea. HFRI was calculated through an ensemble model that combined an integrated model using all factors and a meteorological model using weather factors only. To confirm the generalized performance of the proposed model, all forest fires that occurred from 2014 to 2019 were validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values through one-year-out cross-validation. The AUC value of HFRI ensemble model was 0.8434, higher than the meteorological model. HFRI was compared with the modified version of Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) used in the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating Systems and Daily Weather Index (DWI), South Korea's current forest fire risk index. When compared to DWI and the revised FFMC, HFRI enabled a more spatially detailed and seasonally stable forest fire risk simulation. In addition, the feature contribution to the forest fire risk prediction was analyzed through the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value of Catboost. The contributing variables were in the order of relative humidity, elevation, road density, and population density. It was confirmed that the accessibility factors played very important roles in forest fire risk modeling where most forest fires were caused by anthropogenic factors. The interaction between the variables was also examined.","[Kang, Yoojin; Jang, Eunna; Im, Jungho] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Kwon, Chungeun; Kim, Sungyong] Korea Forest Res Inst, Div Forest Disaster Management, Seoul 02455, South Korea",,"Im, J (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",kangyj@unist.ac.kr; enjang@unist.ac.kr; ersgis@unist.ac.kr; chungeun@korea.kr; kitaco1@korea.kr,,,,,,,54,29,30,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2020,10,22,,,,,,,8213,10.3390/app10228213,0,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Physics,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000594106700001,0,developing a new hourly forest fire risk index based on catboost in south korea

While landscape models can predict erosion from burned areas using the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), post-fire erosion modeling has predominantly focused on areas that have recently burned. Here, we developed and validated a predictive burn severity model that produces continuous dNBR predictions for recently unburned forest land in Utah.ResultsVegetation productivity, elevation, and canopy fuels were the most important predictor variables in the model, highlighting the strong control of fuels and vegetation on burn severity in Utah. Final model out-of-bag R2 was 67.1%, residuals showed a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and classification accuracy into three classes was 85%. We demonstrated that dNBR can be empirically modeled relative to fuels and topography and found burn severity was highest in productive vegetation and at relatively cooler sites.ConclusionsWe found that prediction accuracy was higher when fuel moisture was lower, suggesting drier weather conditions drive more consistent and predictable burn severity patterns across a range of burn severity, vegetation types, and geographic locations. Moreover, burn severity predictions from this model can be used to inform hydro-erosion models and subsequent management actions aimed at reducing burn severity and post-wildfire erosion risks.

Common empirical modelling methods for FOP include both model-based (statistical modelling) and algorithmic-based (machine learning) approaches. However, it was recently shown that many machine learning models in FOP literature are not suitable for fire management operations because of overprediction if not properly calibrated to output true probabilities. We present methods for properly calibrating statistical and machine learning models for fine-scale, spatially explicit daily FOP followed by a case-study comparison of human-caused FOP modelling in the Lac La Biche region of Alberta, Canada, using data from 1996 to 2016. Calibrated bagged classification trees, random forests, neural networks, logistic regression models and logistic generalised additive models (GAMs) are compared in order to assess the pros and cons of these approaches when properly calibrated. Results suggest that logistic GAMs can have similar performance to machine learning models for FOP. Hence, we advocate that the pros and cons of different modelling approaches should be discussed with fire management practitioners when determining which models to use operationally because statistical methods are commonly viewed as more interpretable than machine learning methods.","[Phelps, Nathan; Woolford, Douglas G.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Phelps, Nathan] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Comp Sci, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",,"Woolford, DG (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",dwoolfor@uwo.ca,,,,,,,79,21,23,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,30,11,,,,,850,870,,10.1071/WF20139,0,,sep-21,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000701396900001,0,"comparing calibrated statistical and machine learning methods for wildland fire occurrence prediction: a case study of human-caused fires in lac la biche, alberta, canadac"

Consequently, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive literature analysis of earlier research on fire detection and prediction using the computer vision techniques. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, or PRISMA 2020, are applied in this systematic review. Three databases such as the Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE were searched for pertinent publications to include in this review for this study. The systematic review reveals that existing studies predominantly focused on fire flame rather than smoke detection. Moreover, the majority of research has centered on forest fires in the particular context of occurrence, neglecting indoor or interior environments. Video surveillance systems emerge as the primary source of hardware and datasets utilized in these investigations. Notably, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) stand out as the most frequently employed deep learning approach for classification purposes. The systematic review clarifies the state of fire detection research using computer vision techniques by combining data from several academic sources.

Wildfires are among one of the main drivers leading to losses in forested areas. The increasing availability of free remotely sensed data has enabled the precise locations of wildfires to be reliably monitored. A wildfire data inventory was created by integrating global positioning system (GPS) polygons with data collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product between 2012 and 2017 for Amol County, northern Iran. The GPS polygon dataset from the state wildlife organization was gathered through extensive field surveys. The integrated inventory dataset, along with sixteen conditioning factors (topographic, meteorological, vegetation, anthropological, and hydrological factors), was used to evaluate the potential of different machine learning (ML) approaches for the spatial prediction of wildfire susceptibility. The applied ML approaches included an artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF). All ML approaches were trained using 75% of the wildfire inventory dataset and tested using the remaining 25% of the dataset in the four-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure. The CV method is used for dealing with the randomness effects of the training and testing dataset selection on the performance of applied ML approaches. To validate the resulting wildfire susceptibility maps based on three different ML approaches and four different folds of inventory datasets, the true positive and false positive rates were calculated. In the following, the accuracy of each of the twelve resulting maps was assessed through the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The resulting CV accuracies were 74%, 79% and 88% for the ANN, SVM and RF, respectively.","[Ghorbanzadeh, Omid; Blaschke, Thomas] Salzburg Univ, Dept Geoinformat GIS, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Kamran, Khalil Valizadeh] Univ Tabriz, Dept Remote Sensing & GIS, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran; [Aryal, Jagannath] Univ Tasmania, Discipline Geog & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Naboureh, Amin; Bian, Jinhu] Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Res Ctr Digital Mt & Remote Sensing Applicat, Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Naboureh, Amin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Einali, Jamshid] Univ Zanjan, Dept Geog, Zanjan 4537138791, Iran",,"Ghorbanzadeh, O (corresponding author), Salzburg Univ, Dept Geoinformat GIS, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",omid.ghorbanzadeh@stud.sbg.ac.at,,,,,,,70,109,116,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,2,3,,,,,,,43,10.3390/fire2030043,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000697566600007,0,spatial prediction of wildfire susceptibility using field survey gps data and machine learning approaches

Two methods of machine learning classifications were implemented to determine the risk of fire: MaxENT and random forest. The initial materials to define fire risk factors were satellite images and their products of various spatial and spectral resolution (Landsat TM, Modis TERRA, GMTED2010, VIIRS), vector data (OSM), and bioclimatic variables (WORLDCLIM). The results of the research showed a strong human influence on the risk in this region, despite the low population density. Anthropogenic factors showed a high correlation with the occurrence of wildfires, more than climatic or topographical factors. Other factors affect the risk of fires at the macroscale and microscale, which should be considered when modeling. The random forest method showed better results in the macroscale, however, the maximum entropy model was better in the microscale. The exclusion of variables that do not show a high correlation, does not always improve the modeling results. The random forest presence prediction model is a more accurate method and significantly reduces the risk territory. The reverse is the method of maximum entropy, which is not as accurate and classifies very large areas as endangered. Further study of this topic requires a clearer and conceptually developed approach to the application of remote sensing data. Therefore, this work makes sense to lay the foundations of the future, which is a completely automated fire risk assessment application in the Republic of Sakha. The results can be used in fire prophylactics and planning fire prevention. In the future, to determine the risk well, it is necessary to combine the obtained maps with the seasonal risk determined using indices (for example, the Nesterov index 1949) and the periodic dynamics of forest fires, which Isaev and Utkin studied in 1963. Such actions can help to build an application, with which it will be possible to determine the risk of wildfire and the spread of fire during extreme events.","[Janiec, Piotr; Gadal, Sebastien] Avignon Univ, Univ Cote Azur, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,ESPACE,UMR 7300, F-13545 Aix En Provence 04, France; [Janiec, Piotr; Gadal, Sebastien] North Eastern Fed Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Dept Ecol & Geog, Yakutsk 67000, Russia",,"Gadal, S (corresponding author), Avignon Univ, Univ Cote Azur, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,ESPACE,UMR 7300, F-13545 Aix En Provence 04, France.;Gadal, S (corresponding author), North Eastern Fed Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Dept Ecol & Geog, Yakutsk 67000, Russia.",piotr.janiec@etu.univ-amu.fr; sebastien.gadal@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,47,35,37,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020,12,24,,,,,,,4157,10.3390/rs12244157,0,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000603235300001,0,a comparison of two machine learning classification methods for remote sensing predictive modeling of the forest fire in the north-eastern siberia

Thus, knowledge of spatial patterns of fire danger of the district plays a key role in forest succession and ecological implications. This study's aim was to analyze the spatial pattern of fire danger for the tropical forest of Thuan Chau district using advanced machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine classifier (SVMC), Random Forests (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-Net). For this purpose, a GIS database for the study area was established with 564 forest fire locations and ten forest fire variables. Then, Pearson correlation method was used to assess the correlation of the variables with the forest fire. In the next step, three forest fire danger models, SVMC, RF, and MLP-Net, were trained and validated. Finally, global performance of these models was assessed using the classification accuracy (ACC), Kappa statistics (KS), Area under the curve (AUC). In addition, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to check the prediction performance of these models. The result shows the three models performed well; however, the MLP-Net model has the highest prediction performance (ACC = 81.7, KS = 0.633, and AUC = 0.894), followed by the RF model (ACC = 81.1, KS = 0.621, and AUC = 0.883), and the SVMC model (ACC = 80.2, KS = 0.604, and AUC = 0.867).

The latter offers a rich source of satellite images, from which we can retrieve a huge amount of data that can be used to monitor wildfires. The method used in this paper combines Big Data, Remote Sensing and Data Mining algorithms (Artificial Neural Network and SVM) to process data collected from satellite images over large areas and extract insights from them to predict the occurrence of wildfires and avoid such disasters.

This study evaluates the abilities of the Bayes Network (BN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Multivariate Logistic Regression (MLP) machine learning methods for the prediction and mapping fire susceptibility across the Pu Mat National Park, Nghe An Province, Vietnam. The modeling methodology was formulated based on processing the information from the 57 historical fires and a set of nine spatially explicit explanatory variables, namely elevation, slope degree, aspect, average annual temperate, drought index, river density, land cover, and distance from roads and residential areas. Using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and seven other performance metrics, the models were validated in terms of their abilities to elucidate the general fire behaviors in the Pu Mat National Park and to predict future fires. Despite a few differences between the AUC values, the BN model with an AUC value of 0.96 was dominant over the other models in predicting future fires. The second best was the DT model (AUC = 0.94), followed by the NB (AUC = 0.939), and MLR (AUC = 0.937) models. Our robust analysis demonstrated that these models are sufficiently robust in response to the training and validation datasets change. Further, the results revealed that moderate to high levels of fire susceptibilities are associated with similar to 19% of the Pu Mat National Park where human activities are numerous.

A cellular automaton (CA) is well suited to the dynamic simulation of the spatiotemporal evolution of complex systems, and it is therefore used to model the complex process of forest fire spread. However, the process of forest fire spread is linked with a variety of mutually influencing factors, which are too complex to analyze using conventional approaches. Here, we propose a new method for modeling fire spread, namely LSSVM-CA, in which least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) is combined with a three-dimensional forest fire CA framework. In this approach, the effects of adjacent wind on the law of fire spread are considered and analyzed. The LSSVM is utilized to derive the complex state transformation rules for fire spread by training with a dataset based on actual local data. To validate the proposed model, the forest fire spread area simulated by LSSVM-CA and the actual extracted forest fire spread area were subjected to cross-comparison. The results show that LSSVM-CA performs well in simulating the spread of forest fire and determining the probability of forest fire.","[Xu, Yiqing; Ma, Hao] Nanjing Vocat Univ Ind Technol, Ind Software Engn Technol Res & Dev Ctr, Jiangsu Educ Dept, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Li, Dianjing; Lin, Rong; Zhang, Fuquan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, FQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China.",zfq@njfu.edu.cn,,,,,,,92,15,15,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,13,12,,,,,,,1974,10.3390/f13121974,0,,,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000900850700001,0,modeling forest fire spread using machine learning-based cellular automata in a gis environment

Mapping damaged areas and assessing wildfire susceptibility are necessary to prevent, mitigate, and manage wildfires. In this study, a wildfire susceptibility map was generated using a CNN and metaheuristic optimization algorithms (GWO and ICA) based on images of areas damaged by wildfires. The locations of damaged areas were identified using the damage proxy map (DPM) technique from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected from 2016 to 2020. The DPMs' depicting areas damaged by wildfires were similar to fire perimeters obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). Data regarding damaged areas were divided into a training set (50%) for modeling and a testing set (50%) for assessing the accuracy of the models. Sixteen conditioning factors, categorized as topographical, meteorological, environmental, and anthropological factors, were selected to construct the models. The wildfire susceptibility models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE) analysis. The evaluation results revealed that the hybrid-based CNN-GWO model (AUC = 0.974, RMSE = 0.334) exhibited better performance than the CNN (AUC = 0.934, RMSE = 0.780) and CNN-ICA (AUC = 0.950, RMSE = 0.350) models. Therefore, we conclude that optimizing a CNN with metaheuristics considerably increased the accuracy and reliability of wildfire susceptibility mapping in the study area.","[Nur, Arip Syaripudin; Lee, Chang-Wook] Kangwon Natl Univ, Div Sci Educ, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Kim, Yong Je] Lamar Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4400 MLK Blvd, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA; [Lee, Chang-Wook] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Smart Reg Innovat, Chunchon 24341, South Korea",,"Lee, CW (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Div Sci Educ, Chunchon 24341, South Korea.;Lee, CW (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Smart Reg Innovat, Chunchon 24341, South Korea.",cwlee@kangwon.ac.kr,,,,,,,99,24,24,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,14,17,,,,,,,4416,10.3390/rs14174416,0,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000851991900001,0,"creation of wildfire susceptibility maps in plumas national forest using insar coherence, deep learning, and metaheuristic optimization approaches"

We constructed a dataset of large-scale forest fires from the past decade and employed it in machine learning models that integrate climatic, socioeconomic, and environmental variables to assess the risk of forest fires. According to the results of these models, the eastern region is identified as highly vulnerable to forest fires during the baseline period, while the western region is classified as relatively safe. However, in the future, certain areas along the western coast are predicted to become more susceptible to forest fires.

Therefore, timely and accurate detection of forest and rural wildfires is of great importance for successful fire containment and suppression efforts, as wildfires exponentially increase their spread rate from the moment of ignition. In the field of early smoke detection, the CICLOPE project currently trailblazes in the employment of a network of Remote Acquisition Towers for wildfire prevention and observation, along with a rule-based automatic smoke detection system, covering over 2, 700, 000 hectares of wildland and rural area in continental Portugal. However, the inherent challenges of automatic smoke detection raise issues of high false alarm rates that affect the system's prediction quality and overwhelm the Management and Control Centers with numerous false alarms. The research work presented in this paper evaluates the potential improvement in wildfire smoke detection accuracy and specificity using deep learning-based architectures. It proposes a solution based on a Dual-Channel CNN that can be deployed as a secondary prediction confirmation layer to further refine the CICLOPE automatic smoke detection system. The proposed solution takes advantage of the high true alarm coverage of the current detection system by taking only the predicted alarm images and respective bounding box coordinates as inputs. The Dual-Channel network combines the widely used DenseNet architecture with a novel detail selective network with spatial and channel attention modules trained separately with image data obtained from CICLOPE, fusing the extracted features from both networks in a concatenation layer. The results demonstrate that the proposed Dual-Channel CNN outperforms both single-channel networks, achieving an accuracy of 99.7% and a low false alarm rate of 0.20% when re-examining the alarms produced by the CICLOPE surveillance system.","[Goncalves, Afonso M.] Lovelytics, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Brandao, Tomas; Ferreira, Joao C.] ISTAR, Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ferreira, Joao C.] ISTAR, INOV INESC Inovacao Inst Novas Tecnol, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal",,"Brandao, T (corresponding author), ISTAR, Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",tomas.brandao@iscte-iul.pt,,,,,,,31,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,12,,,,,,82095,82110,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3406215,0,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001251109400001,0,wildfire detection with deep learning-a case study for the ciclope project

To minimize these losses and reduce forest fires, modeling and predicting the occurrence of forest fires are meaningful because they can support forest fire prevention and management. In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has become an important state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, and its implementation has enriched many fields. Therefore, we proposed a spatial prediction model for forest fire susceptibility using a CNN. Past forest fire locations in Yunnan Province, China, from 2002 to 2010, and a set of 14 forest fire influencing factors were mapped using a geographic information system. Oversampling was applied to eliminate the class imbalance, and proportional stratified sampling was used to construct the training/validation sample libraries. A CNN architecture that is suitable for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility was designed and hyperparameters were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. Then, the test dataset was fed into the trained model to construct the spatial prediction map of forest fire susceptibility in Yunnan Province. Finally, the prediction performance of the proposed model was assessed using several statistical measures-Wilcoxon signed-rank test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC). The results confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed CNN model (AUC 0.86) than those of the random forests, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron neural network, and kernel logistic regression benchmark classifiers. The CNN has stronger fitting and classification abilities and can make full use of neighborhood information, which is a promising alternative for the spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility.

We critically assess these models' capabilities in predicting fire susceptibility and post-ignition spread, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Our findings indicate that while traditional models provide foundational insights, they often fall short in dynamically estimating parameters and predicting ignition events. Cellular automata models, despite their potential, face challenges in data integration and computational demands. Conversely, ML models demonstrate superior efficiency and accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, though they encounter interpretability issues. This review recommends hybrid modelling approaches that integrate multiple methods to harness their combined strengths. By incorporating data assimilation techniques with dynamic forecasting models, the predictive capabilities of ML-based predictions can be significantly enhanced.

Consequently, specific strategies, tactics and techniques should always be adopted for the alleviation of this critical phenomenon. Hence, the aim of the paper is the review of the most common geoinformatics-based techniques contributing to an integrated fire analysis through four pillars. The first one is related with the fire exposure on the ground, primarily analyzing the fire susceptibility in terms of fire risk and burn probability maps; The second one examines the fire effects on the most critical ecological and anthropogenic resources and infrastructures. The third pillar combines two effective geospatial tools supporting the wildfire prevention and suppression, such as the visibility analysis for early detection of fire hotspots and the network analysis for strategic and operational planning of fire events. Last, the Earth-Observation module, through the spatiotemporal monitoring and prediction of land use changes, permits the planners to evaluate the underlying pressures (fires, urbanization) against forests developing the appropriate planning guidelines. In the meantime, new perspectives emerge. Novel machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data techniques are expected to improve the fire risk/probability credibility enhancing the more precise identification of fire effects to any resource. The integration of specific geographic criteria (e.g. topography, accessibility) and programming techniques (e.g. maximizing the visible area) to visibility analysis would empower the immediate fire detection. New technologies such as the adoption of drones would be a cost-effective tool for quick retrieval of vital geo-data.

Smoke detection using camera-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offers a promising solution for wildfire prediction. However, the rarity of smoke across time and space limits training data, raising model overfitting and bias concerns. Current DNNs, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, complicate robustness evaluation due to architectural differences. To address these challenges, we introduce WARP (Wildfire Adversarial Robustness Procedure), the first model-agnostic framework for evaluating wildfire detection models' adversarial robustness. WARP addresses inherent limitations in data diversity by generating adversarial examples through image-global and -local perturbations. Global and local attacks superimpose Gaussian noise and PNG patches onto image inputs, respectively; this suits both CNNs and transformers while generating realistic adversarial scenarios. Using WARP, we assessed real-time CNNs and Transformers, uncovering key vulnerabilities. At times, transformers exhibited over 70% precision degradation under global attacks, while both models generally struggled to differentiate cloud-like PNG patches from real smoke during local attacks. To enhance model robustness, we proposed four wildfire-oriented data augmentation techniques based on WARP's methodology and results, which diversify smoke image data and improve model precision and robustness. These advancements represent a substantial step toward developing a reliable early wildfire warning system, which may be our first safeguard against wildfire destruction.","[Ide, Ryo] Harrison High Sch, Harrison, NY 10528 USA; [Yang, Lei] Univ Nevada, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA",,"Yang, L (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",ider@harrisoncsd.org; leiy@unr.edu,,,,,,,40,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2025,8,2,,,,,,,50,10.3390/fire8020050,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001430931900001,0,adversarial robustness for deep learning-based wildfire prediction models

With the development of surveillance and forecasting systems, it is now possible to forebode the most life-threatening and formidable disasters. However, forest fires are among the ones that are still hard to anticipate beforehand, and the technologies to detect and plot their possible courses are still in development. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) image-based fire detection systems can be a viable solution to this problem. However, these automatic systems use advanced deep learning and image processing algorithms at their core and can be tuned to provide accurate outcomes. Therefore, this article proposed a forest fire detection method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using a new fire detection dataset. Notably, our method also uses separable convolution layers (requiring less computational resources) for immediate fire detection and typical convolution layers. Thus, making it suitable for real-time applications. Consequently, after being trained on the dataset, experimental results show that the method can identify forest fires within images with a 97.63% accuracy, 98.00% F1 Score, and 80% Kappa. Hence, if deployed in practical circumstances, this identification method can be used as an assistive tool to detect fire outbreaks, allowing the authorities to respond quickly and deploy preventive measures to minimize damage.","[Rahman, A.

These algorithms are trained to account for a wide collection of geometric characteristics and material properties, as well as loading conditions to examine fire performance of normal and high strength RC columns by analyzing a comprehensive database of fire tests comprising of over 494 observations.

Most importantly, this work tackles the scarcity of available fire tests by proposing new techniques to leverage the use of real, synthetic, and augmented fire test observations. The developed ML ensemble has been calibrated and validated for standard and design fire exposures and one-, two-, three-and four-sided fire exposures thus; covering a wide range of practical scenarios present during fire incidents. When fully deployed, the developed ensemble can analyze over 5,000 RC columns in under 60 s; thus, providing an attractive solution for researchers and practitioners.

This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as vegetation recovery and socio-economic factors, to refine predictions. This study provides critical insights for targeted fire management and land use planning, promoting the sustainable conservation of the Caatinga under changing climatic conditions.","[Vasconcelos, Rodrigo N.; Rocha, Washington J.

We compared several deep learning networks based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework to detect forest flames with the help of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. We used the open datasets of the Fire Luminosity Airborne-based Machine Learning Evaluation (FLAME) to train the YOLOv5 and its sub-versions, together with YOLOv3 and YOLOv4, under equal conditions. The results show that the YOLOv5n model can achieve a detection speed of 1.4 ms per frame, which is higher than that of all the other models. Furthermore, the algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 91.4%. Although this value is slightly lower than that of YOLOv5s, it achieves a trade-off between high accuracy and real-time. YOLOv5n achieved a good flame detection effect in the different forest scenes we set. It can detect small target flames on the ground, it can detect fires obscured by trees or disturbed by the environment (such as smoke), and it can also accurately distinguish targets that are similar to flames. Our future work will focus on improving the YOLOv5n model so that it can be deployed directly on UAV for truly real-time and high-precision forest flame detection. Our study provides a new solution to the early prevention of forest fires at small scales, helping forest police make timely and correct decisions.","[Liu, Haiqing; Hu, Heping; Zhou, Fang; Yuan, Huaping] Hunan Police Acad, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China",,"Yuan, HP (corresponding author), Hunan Police Acad, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China.",yuanhuaping@hnpa.edu.cn,,,,,,,59,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,6,7,,,,,,,279,10.3390/fire6070279,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001038611800001,0,forest flame detection in unmanned aerial vehicle imagery based on yolov5

Due to its complex nature, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches to wildfire prediction, such as machine learning. This research took a unique approach, differentiating from classical supervised learning, and addressed the gap in unsupervised wildfire prediction using autoencoders and clustering techniques for anomaly detection. Historical weather and normalized difference vegetation index data sets of Australia for 2005-2021 were utilized. Two main unsupervised approaches were analyzed. The first used a deep autoencoder to obtain latent features, which were then fed into clustering models, isolation forest, local outlier factor and one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection. The second approach used a deep autoencoder to reconstruct the input data and use reconstruction errors to identify anomalies. Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and fully connected (FC) autoencoders were employed in this part, both in an unsupervised way learning only from nominal data. The FC autoencoder outperformed its counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 0.71, an F1-score of 0.74, and an MCC of 0.42.

The purpose of this study was to develop an intelligent system based on genetic programming for the prediction of burned areas, using only data related to the forest under analysis and meteorological data. We used geometric semantic genetic programming based on recently defined geometric semantic genetic operators for genetic programming. Experimental results, achieved using a database of 517 forest fire events between 2000 and 2003, showed the appropriateness of the proposed system for the prediction of the burned areas. In particular, results obtained with geometric semantic genetic programming were significantly better than those produced by standard genetic programming and other state of the art machine learning methods on both training and out-of-sample data.

The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial variation of wildfire risk on Holy Mount Athos in Greece. Mt. Athos includes 20 monasteries and other structures that are threatened by increasing frequency of wildfires. Site-specific fuel models were created by measuring in the field several fuel parameters in representative natural fuel complexes, while the spatial extent of the fuel types was determined using a synergy of high-resolution imagery and high temporal information from medium spatial resolution imagery classified through object-based analysis and a machine learning classifier. The Minimum Travel Time (MTT) algorithm, as it is embedded in FlamMap software, was applied in order to evaluate Burn Probability (BP), Conditional Flame Length (CFL), Fire Size (FS), and Source-Sink Ratio (SSR). The results revealed low burn probabilities for the monasteries; however, nine out of the 20 monasteries have high fire potential in terms of fire intensity, which means that if an ignition occurs, an intense fire is expected. The outputs of this study may be used for decision-making for short-term predictions of wildfire risk at an operational level, contributing to fire suppression and management of UNESCO World Heritage Properties.","[Mallinis, Giorgos] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Forestry & Management Environm & Nat Resourc, Lab Forest Remote Sensing, Orestiada 68200, Greece; [Mitsopoulos, Ioannis; Beltran, Esteban; Goldammer, Johann Georg] Univ Freiburg, Fire Ecol Res Grp, Global Fire Monitoring Ctr, Georges Kohler Allee 75, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany",,"Mitsopoulos, I (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fire Ecol Res Grp, Global Fire Monitoring Ctr, Georges Kohler Allee 75, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",gmallin@fmenr.duth.gr; ioanmits@gmail.com; esbegan@gmail.com; johann.goldammer@fire.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,49,37,37,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2016,7,2,,,,,,,46,10.3390/f7020046,0,,,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000371896900016,0,"assessing wildfire risk in cultural heritage properties using high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery and spatially explicit fire simulations: the case of holy mount athos, greece"

The primary goal of the study is to utilize Google Earth Engine to compare locations in Gujarat, India, before and after forest fires. High-resolution satellite data were used to assess the amount and types of changes caused by forest fires. The present study meticulously analyzes various environmental variables, i.e., slope orientation, elevation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), drainage density, precipitation, and temperature to understand landscape characteristics and assess wildfire susceptibility. In addition, a sophisticated random forest regression model is used to predict land surface temperature based on a set of environmental parameters. The maps that result depict the geographical distribution of normalized burn ratio and difference normalized burn ratio and land surface temperature forecasts, providing valuable insights into spatial patterns and trends. The findings of this work show that an automated temporal analysis utilizing Google Earth Engine may be used successfully over a wide range of land cover types, providing critical data for future monitoring of such threats.

This study employs eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, particularly SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to map wildfire susceptibility in Izmir Province, T & uuml;rkiye. Incorporating fifteen conditioning factors spanning topography, climate, anthropogenic influences, and vegetation characteristics, machine learning (ML) models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) were used to predict wildfire-prone areas using freely available active fire pixel data (MODIS Active Fire Collection 6 MCD14ML product). The evaluation of the trained ML models showed that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed XGBoost and LightGBM, achieving the highest test accuracy (95.6%). All of the classifiers demonstrated a strong predictive performance, but RF excelled in sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-1 score, making it the preferred model for generating a wildfire susceptibility map and conducting a SHAP analysis. Unlike prevailing approaches focusing solely on global feature importance, this study fills a critical gap by employing a SHAP summary and dependence plots to comprehensively assess each factor's contribution, enhancing the explainability and reliability of the results. The analysis reveals clear associations between factors such as wind speed, temperature, NDVI, slope, and distance to villages with increased fire susceptibility, while rainfall and distance to streams exhibit nuanced effects. The spatial distribution of the wildfire susceptibility classes highlights critical areas, particularly in flat and coastal regions near settlements and agricultural lands, emphasizing the need for enhanced awareness and preventive measures. These insights inform targeted fire management strategies, highlighting the importance of tailored interventions like firebreaks and vegetation management.

Most experiments have focused on particular regions with independent methodology settings, which has hindered the ability of others to reproduce works. Another major challenge is lack of benchmark datasets in this domain, which has made benchmark comparisons almost impossible to conduct.

The RAPT (RAre Class Prediction in the absence of True labels) framework is able to build data adaptive classification models using noisy training labels. It is particularly suitable when expert annotated training samples are difficult to obtain as in the case of wild fires in the tropics. This framework has been used to build burned area maps from MODIS surface reflectance data as features and Active Fire hotspots as training labels that are known to have high commission and omission errors due to the prevalence of cloud cover and smoke, especially in the tropics. Using the RAPT framework we report burned areas for 16 MODIS tiles from 2001 to 2014. The total burned area detected in the tropical forests of South America and South-east Asia during these years is 2,071,378 MODIS (500 m) pixels (approximately 520 K sq. km.), which is almost three times compared to the estimates from collection 5 MODIS MCD64A1 (783,468 MODIS pixels).

Our analysis also indicates that the two products can be complimentary and a combination of the two approaches is likely to provide a more comprehensive assessment of tropical fires.

The scientific community has raised concerns about the transparency and interpretability of ML models in the context of wildfire management, recognizing the need for these models to be both accurate and understandable. The often-opaque nature of complex ML algorithms can obscure the rationale behind their outputs, making it imperative to prioritize clarity and interpretability to ensure that model predictions are not only precise but also actionable. Furthermore, a thorough evaluation of model performance must account for multiple critical factors to ensure the utility and dependability of the results in practical wildfire suppression and management strategies.ResultsThis study unveils a sophisticated spatial deep learning framework grounded in TabNet technology, tailored specifically for delineating areas susceptible to wildfires. To elucidate the predictive interplay between the model's outputs and the contributing variables across a spectrum of inputs, we embark on an exhaustive analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This approach affords a granular understanding of how individual features sway the model's predictions. Furthermore, the robustness of the predictive model is rigorously validated through 5-fold cross-validation techniques, ensuring the dependability of the findings. The research meticulously investigates the spatial heterogeneity of wildfire susceptibility within the designated study locale, unearthing pivotal insights into the nuanced fabric of fire risk that is distinctly local in nature.ConclusionUtilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) visualizations, this research meticulously identifies key variables, quantifies their importance, and demystifies the decision-making mechanics of the model. Critical factors, including temperature, elevation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), aspect, and wind speed, are discerned to have significant sway over the predictions of wildfire susceptibility. The findings of this study accentuate the criticality of transparency in modeling, which facilitates a deeper understanding of wildfire risk factors. By shedding light on the significant predictors within the models, this work enhances our ability to interpret complex predictive models and drives forward the field of wildfire risk management, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective prevention and mitigation strategies. AntecedentesEl entender las complejidades de los impactos de los incendios de vegetacion a traves de los diversos paisajes geograficos, requieren de una detallada comprension de la dinamica del fuego y de las areas de vulnerabilidad, particularmente en regiones propensas y con alto riesgo de incendios. El aprendizaje automatico (Machine Learning o ML, en idioma ingles), aparece como un formidable aliado para abordar las complejidades asociadas con la prediccion y el mapeo de esos riesgos. Sin embargo, la confiabilidad de estos enfoques usando esta tecnica de aprendizaje automatico (ML) es altamente dependiente de la integridad de los datos y de la robustez de los protocolos de entrenamiento. La comunidad cientifica ha sembrado dudas sobre la transparencia e interpretacion de los modelos de ML en el contexto del manejo del fuego, reconociendo la necesidad de que esos modelos sean a su vez precisos y entendibles. La frecuentemente opaca naturaleza de los complejos algoritmos del ML, pueden oscurecer la racionalidad que debe haber por detras de los resultados, haciendose imperativo el priorizar la claridad e interpretacion para asegurar que los modelos de prediccion no solo sean precisos sino tambien procesables. Adicionalmente, una completa evaluacion de la performance del modelo en cuanto a los multiples factores criticos debe tenerse en cuenta para asegurar la utilidad y dependencia de los resultados en estrategias de practicas de supresion y manejo del fuego.ResultadosEste estudio devela un marco espacialmente sofisticado de aprendizaje profundo (deeep learnig) basado en tecnologia de TabNet, disenado especificamente para delinear areas susceptibles a incendios de vegetacion. Para dilucidar las interacciones predictivas entre los resultados del modelo y las variables contributivas a traves de un espectro de entradas, nos embarcamos en un analisis exhaustivo usando SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Esta aproximacion aborda un entendimiento granular sobre como las caracteristicas individuales influencian las predicciones del modelo. Ademas, la robustez del modelo predictivo fue rigurosamente validado 5 veces a traves de tecnicas de validacion cruzadas, asegurando la dependencia de los resultados. EL trabajo investigo meticulosamente la variabilidad espacial de la susceptibilidad dentro del estudio local, desenterrando ideas fundamentales sobre riesgo de incendios que implican matices distintivos de naturaleza local.ConclusionesUtilizando visualizaciones del SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), esta investigacion identifico meticulosamente variables clave, cuantifico su importancia y desmitifico la mecanica de toma de decisiones del modelo. Los factores criticos, incluyendo temperatura, elevacion, el NDVI (indice Normalizado de Diferencias de Vegetacion), aspecto, y velocidad del viento, fueron descifrados para que tengan una influencia significativa en la prediccion de la susceptibilidad a los incendios. Los resultados de este estudio acentuan la critica a la transparencia de los modelos, lo que facilita un entendimiento mas profundo de los factores criticos del riesgo de incendios. Mediante el esclarecimiento de los predictores significativos del modelo, este trabajo aumenta nuestra habilidad para interpretar modelos predictivos complejos, e impulsa hacia adelante el campo del manejo del riesgo de incendios, contribuyendo en ultima instancia al desarrollo de estrategias de prevencion y mitigacion mas efectivas.","[Qayyum, Faiza] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju City, South Korea; [Jamil, Harun] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Jeju City, South Korea; [Alsboui, Tariq] Univ Huddersfield, Dept Comp Sci, Huddersfield City, England; [Hijjawi, Mohammad] Appl Sci Private Univ, Amman City, Jordan",,"Alsboui, T (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Dept Comp Sci, Huddersfield City, England.",T.alsboui@hud.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 26,2024,20,1,,,,,,,10,10.1186/s42408-023-00236-w,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001148971600001,0,wildfire risk exploration: leveraging shap and tabnet for precise factor analysis

Moreover, we focus on a better understanding of the impacts of different factors so as to inform preventive actions. To validate our models and findings, we divide the land of California into 4,242 grids of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees in latitude and longitude, and compute the risk of each grid based on spatial and temporal conditions. To verify the generalizability of our models, we further expand the scope of wildfire risk assessment from California to Washington without any fine tuning.

To achieve such accurate long-term forecasts at a global scale, it is crucial to employ models that account for the Earth system's inherent spatio-temporal interactions, such as memory effects and teleconnections. We propose a teleconnection-driven vision transformer (TeleViT), capable of treating the Earth as one interconnected system, integrating fine-grained local-scale inputs with global-scale inputs, such as climate indices and coarse-grained global variables. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate the superiority of TeleViT in accurately predicting global burned area patterns for various forecasting windows, up to four months in advance.

Global fire controls related to climate, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity are usually intertwined, and difficult to disentangle in a quantitative way. Here, we leveraged an ensemble of five machine learning (ML) models and multiple satellite-based observations to conduct global fire modeling for three fire metrics (burned area, fire number, and fire size), and quantified driving mechanisms underlying annual fire changes in a spatially resolved manner for the period 2003-2019. Ensemble learning is a meta-approach that combines multiple ML predictions to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance. We found that the optimized ensemble ML well reproduced annual dynamics of global burned area (R2 = 0.90, P < 0.001), total fire numbers (R2 = 0.86, P < 0.001), and averaged fire size (R2 = 0.70, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ensemble ML captured key spatial patterns of multi-year mean magnitudes, annual variabilities, anomalies, and trends for different fire metrics. Our ML-based fire attributions further highlighted the dominant role of enhanced anthropogenic activity in reducing global burned area (-1.9 Mha/yr, P < 0.01), followed by climate control (-1.3 Mha/yr, P < 0.01) and insignificant positive vegetation control (0.4 Mha/yr, P = 0.60). Spatially, climate dominated a much larger burned area (53.7%) than human (23.4%) or vegetation control (22.9%); however, the counteracting effects from regional wetting and drying trends weakened the net climate impacts on global burned area. The fire number and fire size exhibited similar spatial control patterns with burned area; globally, however, fire number tended to be more affected by climate while fire size more influenced by human activities. Overall, our study confirmed the feasibility and efficiency of ensemble ML in global fire modeling and subsequent control attributions, providing a better understanding of contemporary fire regimes and contributing to robust fire projections in a changing environment.","[Zhang, Yulong; Tang, Rongyun] Univ Tennessee, Inst Secure & Sustainable Environm, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Zhang, Yulong; Mao, Jiafu; Ricciuto, Daniel M.; Shi, Xiaoying; Wullschleger, Stan] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Zhang, Yulong] USDA Forest Serv, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Southern Res Stn, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Yu, Yan] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jicheng] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, CISESS, College Pk, MD USA; [Liu, Jicheng] NOAA, NESDIS Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, College Pk, MD USA",,"Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Inst Secure & Sustainable Environm, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Zhang, YL; Mao, JF (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",ylzhang.planet@gmail.com; maoj@ornl.gov,,,,,,,69,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2023,7,,,,,,,,100088,10.1016/j.srs.2023.100088,0,,may-23,,Environmental Sciences; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001031970700001,0,global fire modelling and control attributions based on the ensemble machine learning and satellite observations

Weather conditions continue to grow more extreme, and wildfires are occurring quite frequently and are spreading with greater intensity. Wildfires ravage forest areas, as recently seen in the Amazon, the United States, and more recently in Australia. The availability of remotely sensed data has vastly improved, and enables us to precisely locate wildfires for monitoring purposes. Wildfire inventory data was created by integrating the polygons collected through field surveys using global positioning systems (GPS) and the data collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product between 2012 and 2017 for the study area. The inventory data, along with sixteen conditioning factors selected for the study area, was used to appraise the potential of various machine learning (ML) methods for wildfire susceptibility mapping in Amol County. The ML methods chosen for this study are artificial neural network (ANN), dmine regression (DR), DM neural, least angle regression (LARS), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), radial basis function (RBF), self-organizing maps (SOM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT), along with the statistical approach of logistic regression (LR), which is very apt for wildfire susceptibility studies. The wildfire inventory data was categorized as three-fold, with 66% being used for training the models and 33% being used for accuracy assessment within three-fold cross-validation (CV). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was used to assess the accuracy of the ML approaches. RF had the highest accuracy of 88%, followed by SVM with an accuracy of almost 79%, and LR had the lowest accuracy of 65%.

Recent studies demonstrate that employing joint modeling techniques using diverse datasets alongside Convolutional Neural Networks -Long Short -Term Memory Networks (ConvLSTM) produces favorable predictive results. However, previous research inadequately explored the different impact of factors across different categories and spatial orientations, and neglected the impact of fuels and human activities inside the samples. This study focuses on the six eastern provinces of China, utilizing a multi -source dataset comprising satellite -monitored wildfire products from 2012 to 2022, along with various factors indicating terrestrial and human activities, simulated meteorological elements and high -resolution vegetation imagery. By introducing channel and spatial attention mechanisms and visual transformer mode, this research optimizes the ConvLSTM wildfire prediction model. Results indicate a noteworthy enhancement, elevating accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and AUC of ROC curves from 91.15%, 80.87%, and 97.01% to 92.79%, 84.48%, and 97.90%, respectively. Consequently, it reinforces the accuracy by increase of the structural features within samples and quantifying the differences in the importance of different factors, which is also validated by prediction application of the samples in the entire year of 2023. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the current model is still highly dependent on the meteorological factors. Notably, the impact of structural features significantly surpasses the influence of terrain and terrestrial ecology elements, which should be considered in further models. Thus, this study has developed a methodology integrating multiple attention mechanisms and sample structural features, which could furnish high -precision daily kilometer -level wildfire risk prediction products.

This research proposes and evaluates a new modeling approach based on TensorFlow deep neural networks (TFDeepNN) and geographic information systems (GIS) for forest fire danger modeling. Herein, TFDeepNN was used to create a forest fire danger model, whereas the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimization algorithm was used to optimize the model, and GIS with Python programming was used to process, classify, and code the input and output. The modeling focused on the tropical forests of the Phu Yen Province (Vietnam), which incorporates 306 historical forest fire locations from 2019 to 2023 and ten forest-fire-driving factors. Random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) were used as a baseline for the model comparison. Different statistical metrics, such as F-score, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve (AUC), were employed to evaluate the models' predictive performance. According to the results, the TFDeepNN model (with F-score of 0.806, accuracy of 79.3%, and AUC of 0.873) exhibits high predictive performance and surpasses the performance of the three baseline models: RF, SVM, and LR; therefore, TFDeepNN represents a novel tool for spatially predicting forest fire danger. The forest fire danger map from this study can be helpful for policymakers and authorities in Phu Yen Province, aiding sustainable land-use planning and management.","[Truong, Tran Xuan; Phuong, Doan Thi Nam; Nghi, Le Thanh] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Fac Geomat & Land Adm, Dept Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Nhu, Viet-Ha] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Dept Geol Geotech Engn, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Hung, Nguyen Nhu] Le Quy Don Tech Univ, Inst Tech Special Engn, Dept Geodesy & Cartog, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Hoa, Pham Viet] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City Inst Resources Geog, Mac Dinh Chi 1, 1 Dist, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Bui, Dieu Tien] Univ South Eastern Norway, Dept Business & IT, GIS Grp, Gullbringvegen 36, N-3800 Bo ITelemark, Norway",,"Bui, DT (corresponding author), Univ South Eastern Norway, Dept Business & IT, GIS Grp, Gullbringvegen 36, N-3800 Bo ITelemark, Norway.",tranxuantruong@humg.edu.vn; dieu.t.bui@usn.no,,,,,,,86,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,15,14,,,,,,,3458,10.3390/rs15143458,0,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001037648700001,0,a new approach based on tensorflow deep neural networks with adam optimizer and gis for spatial prediction of forest fire danger in tropical areas

By leveraging high-resolution data collected through autonomous drone missions, our system enhances wildfire risk estimation and enables proactive mission planning. Although the system is mainly designed to address wildfire monitoring using drone-collected data, it can be easily adapted to other environmental monitoring applications and other sources of data.

Problem: Forest Fires are an issue that greatly affect human life and the ecological order, leaving long-term issues. It should be estimated because it is not known when, where and how much the fire will be in the area. Objective: The objective of the research is to use artificial neural networks to estimate the burned areas in forest fires. Methodology: A feed-forward backpropagation neural network model was used for estimating the burned areas. Results: We performed a performance evaluation over the proposed model by considering Regression values, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The results show that the model is efficient in terms of its estimation of burnt areas. Conclusions: The proposed artificial neural network model has a low error rate and high estimation accuracy. It is more effective than traditional methods for estimating burned areas in forests. Originality: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this real, unique data has been used for building and testing the model's estimations and the improvements that have been made in producing results faster and more accurately than with traditional methods. Limitations: Since there are regional differences over different forest areas, effective criteria need to be analysed regarding the target regions.","[Calp, M.

We used extreme threshold values of three Canadian Fire Weather Index System (CFWIS) variables-the fine fuel moisture code (FFMC), initial spread index (ISI), and fire weather index (FWI)-as a proxy for spread days. Then we used self-organizing maps (SOMs) to predict spread days, with sea-level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential height as predictors. SOMs require many input parameters, and we performed an experiment to optimize six key parameters. For each month of the fire season (May-August), we also tested whether SOMs performed better when trained with only one month or with neighbouring months as well. Good performance (AUC of 0.8) was achieved for FFMC and ISI, while nearly good performance was achieved for FWI.

Applied nucleation (AN) could be a valuable active restoration approach for promoting natural recovery in forest ecosystems affected by stand-replacing disturbances as it improves seed availability and microsite conditions.Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the potential of AN under different scenarios in a mountain forest ecosystem of the Northwestern Italian Alps dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The area was affected by a large stand-replacing fire in 2005 and post-fire salvage logging that amplified ecosystem degradation and dampened natural tree regeneration.Methods: We assessed the main drivers guiding natural post-fire natural recovery and identified suitable sites for tree regeneration through a machine learning correlative model (Bayesian Additive Regression Tree, BART). Specifically, we used several environmental predictors (e.g., topography, wind direction, and distance from seed trees) to model the occurrence of natural tree regeneration. We predicted the probability of tree regeneration presence at landscape scale under the current situation (fire followed by salvage logging) and a set of AN scenarios characterized by an increase in nuclei density, since distance from seed trees emerged as the most important driver for natural tree regeneration. Starting from the situation 16 years after the fire, we reclassified the prediction raster into a binary map of intervention priority (priority and non-priority patches), using the probability value that maximized the model accuracy (true skill statistic; TSS) as threshold. Patches with scarce pine regeneration were considered as high intervention priority sites for AN. These predictions made it possible to assess the most efficient active management scenario in terms of promoting forest recovery.Conclusions: The simulations showed the positive effects of AN on natural tree regeneration and the importance of site selection for plantations, proving that AN could be a promising post-fire management technique that can minimize human interventions and their associated economic and ecological costs. To our knowledge, this work is the first AN simulation in a temperate mountain ecosystem. The selection of favorable sites can be further improved by considering fine-scale characteristics through field experiments and cross-scale integration.","[Mantero, Giulia; Anselmetto, Nicolo; Morresi, Donato; Meloni, Fabio; Garbarino, Matteo; Marzano, Raffaella] Univ Torino, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Braccini 2, IT-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Bolzon, Paola; Lingua, Emanuele] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, IT-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",,"Mantero, G (corresponding author), Univ Torino, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Braccini 2, IT-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy.",giulia.mantero@unito.it,,,,,,,71,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 1,2024,551,,,,,,,,121520,10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121520,0,,nov-23,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001106953700001,0,modeling post-fire regeneration patterns under different restoration scenarios to improve forest recovery in degraded ecosystems

The reason of this study is to built up a smart system based on semantic neural networking for the forecast of burned areas. The usage of virtual reality simulator is used to support the instruction process of fire fighters and all users for saving of surrounded wild lives by using a naive method Semantic Neural Network System (SNNS). Semantics are valuable initially to have a enhanced representation of the burned area prediction and better alteration of simulation situation to the users.

Smoke forecasting systems have the potential to improve health outcomes by providing future estimates of surface aerosol concentrations (and health hazards) over a period of several days. In most operational smoke forecasting systems, fire emissions are assumed to remain constant during the duration of the weather forecast and are initialized using satellite observations. Recent work suggests that it may be possible to improve these models by predicting the temporal evolution of emissions. Here, we develop statistical models to predict fire activity one to five days into the future using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite fire counts and weather data from ERA-interim reanalysis. Our predictive framework consists of two-Poisson regression models that separately represent new ignitions and the dynamics of existing fires on a coarse resolution spatial grid. We use ten years of active fire detections in Alaska to develop the model and use a cross-validation approach to evaluate model performance. Our results show that regression methods are significantly more accurate in predicting daily fire activity than persistence-based models (which suffer from an overestimation of fire counts by not accounting for fire extinction), with vapor pressure deficit being particularly effective as a single weather-based predictor in the regression approach.","[Graff, Casey A.; Smyth, Padhraic] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Coffield, Shane R.; Chen, Yang; Foufoula-Georgiou, Efi; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Foufoula-Georgiou, Efi] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"Graff, CA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",caseyagraff@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,21,25,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2020,58,7,,,,,4837,4851,,10.1109/TGRS.2020.2968029,0,,,,"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Engineering; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000543775800028,0,forecasting daily wildfire activity using poisson regression

This research aims to develop a new ensemble learning model, HHO-RSCDT, capable of accurately predicting spatial patterns of forest fire danger. The HHO-RSCDT method combines three distinct components, namely Random Subspace (RS), Credal Decision Tree (CDT), and Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO). Herein, RS generates a series of subspace datasets, which are subsequently utilized to produce individual CDT classifiers. Then, HHO optimizes the ensemble model, enabling the model to achieve higher predictive performance. The model was trained and validated using a forest fire dataset at Phu Yen province, Vietnam. The dataset includes 306 forest fire locations and ten influencing factors from the study province. The results showed the capability of the HHO-RSCDT model in predicting forest fire danger, with an accuracy rate of 83.7%, a kappa statistic of 0.674, and an AUC of 0.911. A comparison between the HHO-RSCDT model and two state-of-the-art machine learning methods, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), indicated that the HHO-RSCDT performs better, making it a valuable tool for modeling forest fire danger. The forest fire danger map produced using this novel model could be a new tool for local authorities in the Phu Yen province, assisting them in managing and protecting the forest ecosystem.

Conventional detection approaches fall short due to spatial limitations and manual feature engineering, which calls for the exploration and development of data-driven deep learning solutions. This paper, in this regard, proposes 'FireXnet', a tailored deep learning model designed for improved efficiency and accuracy in wildfire detection. FireXnet is tailored to have a lightweight architecture that exhibits high accuracy with significantly less training and testing time. It contains considerably reduced trainable and non-trainable parameters, which makes it suitable for resource-constrained devices. To make the FireXnet model visually explainable and trustable, a powerful explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tool, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has been incorporated. It interprets FireXnet's decisions by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction. Furthermore, the performance of FireXnet is compared against five pre-trained models - VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2 - to benchmark its efficiency. For a fair comparison, transfer learning and fine-tuning have been applied to the aforementioned models to retrain the models on our dataset.ResultsThe test accuracy of the proposed FireXnet model is 98.42%, which is greater than all other models used for comparison. Furthermore, results of reliability parameters confirm the model's reliability, i.e., a confidence interval of [0.97, 1.00] validates the certainty of the proposed model's estimates and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.98 proves that decisions of FireXnet are in considerable accordance with the given data.ConclusionThe integration of the robust feature extraction of FireXnet with the transparency of explainable AI using SHAP enhances the model's interpretability and allows for the identification of key characteristics triggering wildfire detections. Extensive experimentation reveals that in addition to being accurate, FireXnet has reduced computational complexity due to considerably fewer training and non-training parameters and has significantly fewer training and testing times.","[Ahmad, Khubab] Multimedia Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Bukit Beruang 75450, Malaysia; [Khan, Muhammad Shahbaz; Ahmad, Jawad] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Built Environm, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Scotland; [Ahmed, Fawad] NUST, Pakistan Navy Engn Coll, Dept Cyber Secur, Karachi 75350, Pakistan; [Driss, Maha; Boulila, Wadii] Prince Sultan Univ, Robot & Internet Things Lab, Riyadh 12435, Saudi Arabia; [Driss, Maha; Boulila, Wadii] Univ Manouba, Natl Sch Comp Sci, RIADI Lab, Manouba 2010, Tunisia; [Alazeb, Abdulwahab; Alsulami, Mohammad; Alshehri, Mohammed S.] Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Najran 61441, Saudi Arabia; [Ghadi, Yazeed Yasin] Al Ain Univ, Dept Software Engn, Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi 1555, U Arab Emirates",,"Ahmad, J (corresponding author), Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Built Environm, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Scotland.",j.ahmad@napier.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,sep-20,2023,19,1,,,,,,,54,10.1186/s42408-023-00216-0,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001067087100001,0,retracted: firexnet: an explainable ai-based tailored deep learning model for wildfire detection on resource-constrained devices

The demand for risk assessment is increasing due to the escalating severity of wildfires. A quick and cost-effective method is required to mitigate foreseeable disasters. In this study, a method for tree detection and fuel amount and distribution prediction using aerial images was proposed for a low-cost and efficient acquisition of fuel information. Three-dimensional (3D) fuel information (height) from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) was matched to two-dimensional (2D) fuel information (crown width) from aerial photographs to establish a statistical prediction model in northeastern South Korea. Quantile regression for 0.05, 0.5, and 0.95 quantiles was performed. Subsequently, an allometric tree model was used to predict the diameter at the breast height. The performance of the prediction model was validated using physically measured data by laser distance meter triangulation and direct measurement from a field survey. The predicted quantile, 0.5, was adequately matched to the measured quantile, 0.5, and most of the measured values lied within the predicted quantiles, 0.05 and 0.95. Therefore, in the developed prediction model, only 2D images were required to predict a few of the 3D fuel details. The proposed method can significantly reduce the cost and duration of data acquisition for the investigation and risk assessment of wildfires.","[Kwon, Kyeongnam; Im, Seong-kyun] Korea Univ, Mech Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Kwon, Chun Geun; Lee, Ye-eun; Kim, Sung Yong] Natl Inst Forest Sci, Seoul 02455, South Korea; [Kim, Sung Yong] Andong Natl Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Andong 36729, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea",,"Kwon, CG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Forest Sci, Seoul 02455, South Korea.",chungeun@korea.kr,,,,,,,56,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,14,11,,,,,,,2126,10.3390/f14112126,0,,,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001107896400001,0,aerial imaging-based fuel information acquisition for wildfire research in northeastern south korea

Therefore, spatial predictions of the potential for large wildfires have immediate and growing relevance to near- and long-term research, planning, and management objectives. Fuels, climate, weather, and the landscape all exert controls on wildfire occurrence and spread, but the dynamics of these controls vary from daily to decadal timescales. Accurate spatial predictions of large wildfires should therefore strive to integrate across these variables and timescales. Here, we describe a high spatial resolution dataset (250m pixel) of the probability of large wildfires ( > 405 ha) across forests and woodlands in the contiguous western US, from 2005 to the present. The dataset is automatically updated on a weekly basis using Google Earth Engine and a continuous integration pipeline. Each image in the dataset is the output of a random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on random samples of historic small and large wildfires and represents the predicted conditional probability of an individual pixel burning in a large fire, given an ignition or fire spread to that pixel. This novel workflow is able to integrate the near- term dynamics of fuels and weather into weekly predictions while also integrating longer-term dynamics of fuels, the climate, and the landscape. As a continually updated product, the dataset can provide operational fire managers with contemporary, onthe- ground information to closely monitor the changing potential for large wildfire occurrence and spread. It can also serve as a foundational dataset for longer-term planning and research, such as the strategic targeting of fuels management, fire-smart development at the wildland-urban interface, and the analysis of trends in wildfire potential over time.

However, current operational models suffer from significant limitations regarding accuracy and transferability. Recent advances in the availability and capability of Earth observation data and artificial intelligence offer new perspectives for data-driven modeling approaches with the potential to overcome the existing limitations. Therefore, this study developed a data-driven Deep Learning wildfire spread modeling approach based on a comprehensive dataset of European wildfires and a Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network, which was applied to this modeling problem for the first time. A country-scale model was developed on an individual wildfire time series in Portugal while a second continental-scale model was developed with wildfires from the entire Mediterranean region. While neither model was able to predict the daily spread of European wildfires with sufficient accuracy (weighted macro-mean IoU: Portugal model 0.37; Mediterranean model 0.36), the continental model was able to learn the generalized patterns of wildfire spread, achieving similar performances in various fire-prone Mediterranean countries, indicating an increased capacity in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we found that the spatial and temporal dimensions of wildfires significantly influence model performance. Inadequate reference data quality most likely contributed to the low overall performances, highlighting the current limitations of data-driven wildfire spread models.","[Roesch, Moritz; Nolde, Michael; Riedlinger, Torsten] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Roesch, Moritz; Ullmann, Tobias] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Dept Remote Sensing, John Skilton Str 4a, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",,"Rösch, M (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.;Rösch, M (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Dept Remote Sensing, John Skilton Str 4a, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",moritz.roesch@dlr.de; michael.nolde@dlr.de; tobias.ullmann@uni-wuerzburg.de; torsten.riedlinger@dlr.de,,,,,,,66,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2024,7,6,,,,,,,207,10.3390/fire7060207,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001256528400001,0,data-driven wildfire spread modeling of european wildfires using a spatiotemporal graph neural network

Following an analysis of forest fire boundaries in the northern region of Yangyuan County, located in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, China, several key factors influencing the formation of fire boundaries were identified. These factors include the topography, vegetation, climate, and human activity. To explore the impact of these factors in different spaces on potential results, we varied the distances between matched sample points and built six fire environment models with different sampling distances. We constructed a matched case-control conditional light gradient boosting machine (MCC CLightGBM) to model these environment models and analyzed the factors influencing fire boundary formation and the spatial locations of the predicted boundaries. Our results show that the MCC CLightGBM model performs better when points on the selected boundaries are paired with points within the burned areas, specifically between 120 m and 480 m away from the boundaries. By using the MCC CLightGBM model to predict the probability of boundary formation under six environmental models at different distances, we found that fire boundaries are most likely to form near roads and populated areas. Boundary formation is also influenced by areas with significant topographic relief. It should be noted explicitly that this conclusion is only applicable to this study region and has not been validated for other different regions. Finally, the matched case-control conditional random forest (MCC CRF) model was constructed for comparison experiments. The MCC CLightGBM model demonstrates potential in predicting fire boundaries and fills a gap in research on fire boundary predictions in this area which can be useful in future forest fire management, allowing for a quick and intuitive assessment of where a fire has stopped.","[Xu, Yiqing] Nanjing Vocat Univ Ind Technol, Sch Comp & Software, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yanyan; Zhang, Fuquan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hanyuan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nanjing 210097, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, FQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China.",yiqingxu@niit.edu.cn; sun8023yan@163.com; zfq@njfu.edu.cn; w22004678@northumbria.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,14,7,,,,,,,1458,10.3390/f14071458,0,,,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001036196200001,0,"modeling fire boundary formation based on machine learning in liangshan, china"

Wildfire susceptibility mapping is an essential technique for assessing areas prone to wildfires. In this study, we proposed the combination of the damage proxy map (DPM) and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) method to generate a precise wildfire inventory map and used it to predict areas susceptible to wildfire. The wildfire susceptibility maps were produced using frequency ratio (FR), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep learning and their performances were compared. We implemented the proposed method on Maui Island, Hawaii, where wildfires frequently occur. We started the process by generating a wildfire inventory map from 2019 to 2023 based on the DPM method applied to Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data combined with a dNBR map retrieved from Sentinel-2 data. The wildfire inventory was randomly divided into a training dataset (70%) and a testing dataset (30%). Fifteen wildfire-related factors, including topographical, meteorological, land use, environmental, and anthropological factors, were selected to predict wildfires. The wildfire-related factors were selected by conducting study literature and considering spatial correlation analysis based on the FR method, information gain ratio analysis (IGR), and multicollinearity assessment using tolerance (TOL) and variance inflation factor (VIF) metrics. The level of susceptibility of an area to wildfire is divided into five, namely very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. The FR, CNN, and LSTM produced wildfire susceptibility maps with similar patterns, significantly influenced by land use and rainfall factors. The highly susceptible areas are located on gentle slopes covered by agricultural land and unhealthy vegetation, and these areas have low rainfall intensity but receive high levels of solar radiation. Meanwhile, areas with relatively low susceptibility occur in forests with high levels of wet canopy evaporation. The prediction results were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and the CNN performed slightly better than the FR and LSTM, with AUC values of 0.879, 0.877, and 0.870, respectively. Hence, the use of the CNN algorithm in the proposed method is appropriate, specifically for the study area. In addition, the susceptibility map provides information on susceptible areas on Maui Island, Hawaii, to increase public awareness.","[Ramayanti, Suci; Kim, BongChan; Lee, Chang-Wook] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Sci Educ, Chuncheon Si, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Park, Sungjae; Lee, Chang-Wook] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Smart Reg Innovat, Chuncheon Si, Gangwon Do, South Korea",,"Lee, CW (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Sci Educ, Chuncheon Si, Gangwon Do, South Korea.;Lee, CW (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Smart Reg Innovat, Chuncheon Si, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",cwlee@kangwon.ac.kr,,,,,,,77,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 31,2024,61,1,,,,,,,2353982,10.1080/15481603.2024.2353982,0,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,Physical Geography; Remote Sensing,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001222872200001,0,"wildfire susceptibility mapping by incorporating damage proxy maps, differenced normalized burn ratio, and deep learning algorithms based on sentinel-1/2 data: a case study on maui island, hawaii"

This study improved the accuracy and effect of wildfire danger assessment using the time series features of weather and fuel. First, the time series features of weather and fuel factors within the 16 days before the fire were analyzed. Then, four feature groups were selected-feature group without time series values, feature group with time series values, feature group with Tsfresh transformation of time series values, and feature group with gradient and cumulative transformation of time series values-and three models were trained, respectively: random forest, balanced random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. The results showed that the f1-score of all feature groups with time series values (0.93) increased by 0.15, on average, compared with those without time series values (0.78) for the three models. The feature group with gradient and cumulative features had a more stable prediction accuracy and a more accurate wildfire danger map.

Mitigating or eliminating the adverse effects of such fires on the service functions of urban ecosystems, while enhancing the resilience of urban greening systems in disaster prevention and risk reduction, has become a pivotal challenge in modern urban development and management. Academic focus has progressively broadened from isolated urban and forest domains to encompass the more intricate environments of the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and urban-suburban forests, with a particular emphasis on the distinctive characteristics of urban greening and in-depth research. This study employs a combination of CiteSpace bibliometric analysis and a narrative literature review to comprehensively examine three critical aspects of urban fire safety as follows: (1) the evaluation of the fire-resistant performance of landscape plants in urban green spaces; (2) the mechanisms of fire behavior in urban greening systems; and (3) the assessment and prediction of urban fire risks. Our findings indicate that landscape plants play a crucial role in controlling the spread of fires in urban green spaces by providing physical barriers and inhibiting combustion processes, thereby mitigating fire propagation. However, the diversity and non-native characteristics of urban greenery species present challenges. The existing research lacks standardized experimental indicators and often focuses on single-dimensional analyses, leading to conclusions that are limited, inconsistent, or even contradictory. Furthermore, most current fire spread models are designed primarily for forests and wildland-urban interface (WUI) regions. Empirical and semi-empirical models dominate this field, yet future advancements will likely involve coupled models that integrate climate and environmental factors. Fire risk assessment and prediction represent a global research hotspot, with machine learning- and deep learning-based approaches increasingly gaining prominence. These advanced methods have demonstrated superior accuracy compared to traditional techniques in predicting urban fire risks.

The degradation of the grassland ecosystem in South Africa is increasing alarmingly, and fire is regarded as one of the major culprits. Globally, anthropogenic climate changes have altered fire regimes in the grassland biome. Integrated fire-risk assessment systems provide an integral approach to fire prevention and mitigate the negative impacts of fire. However, fire risk-assessment is extremely challenging, owing to the myriad of factors that influence fire ignition and behaviour. Most fire danger systems do not consider fire causes; therefore, they are inadequate in validating the estimation of fire danger. Thus, fire danger assessment models should comprise the potential causes of fire. Understanding the key drivers of fire occurrence is key to the sustainable management of South Africa's grassland ecosystems. Therefore, this study explored six statistical and machine learning models-the frequency ratio (FR), weight of evidence (WoE), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to assess fire danger in an Afromontane grassland protected area (PA). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve results (ROC/AUC) revealed that DT showed the highest precision on model fit and success rate, while the WoE was used to record the highest prediction rate (AUC = 0.74). The WoE model showed that 53% of the study area is susceptible to fire. The land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation condition index (VCI) were the most influential factors. Corresponding analysis suggested that the fire regime of the study area is fuel-dominated. Thus, fire danger management strategies within the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) should include fuel management aiming at correctly weighing the effects of fuel in fire ignition and spread.","[Mofokeng, Olga D.; Adelabu, Samuel A.; Jackson, Colbert M.] Univ Free State, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Geog, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa",,"Adelabu, SA (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Geog, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",2004199796@ufs4life.ac.za; adelabusa@ufs.ac.za; jackson.c@ufs.ac.za,,,,,,,186,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2024,7,2,,,,,,,61,10.3390/fire7020061,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001172436300001,0,an integrated grassland fire-danger-assessment system for a mountainous national park using geospatial modelling techniques

This paper focuses on increasingly widespread forest fires, causing greater destruction in recent years. Data obtained from sensors for predicting forest fires and assessing fire severity, i.e., area burned, are multivariate, seasonal, and highly imbalanced with a ratio of 100,000+ non-fire events to 1 fire event. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal Agnostic Sampling (STAS) to overcome the challenge of highly imbalanced data. This paper first presents a mathematical understanding of fire and non-fire events and then a thorough complexity analysis of the proposed STAS framework and two existing methods, NearMiss and SMOTE. Further, to investigate the applicability of STAS, binary classification models (to determine the probability of forest fire) and regression models (to assess the severity of forest fire) were built on the data generated from STAS. A total of 432 experiments were conducted to validate the robustness of the STAS parameters. Additional experiments with a temporal data split were conducted to further validate the results. The results show that 180 of the 216 binary classification models had an F1 score>0.9 and 150 of the 216 regression models had an R-2 score>0.75.

Severe fires kill and consume large amounts of above- and belowground biomass and affect soils, resulting in long-lasting consequences for vegetation, aquatic ecosystem productivity and diversity, and other ecosystem properties. We analyzed the occurrence of, and trends in, satellite-derived burn severity across six ecoregions in the Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States from 1984 to 2006 using data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Using 1,024 fires from the Northwest (4,311,871 ha) and 497 fires from the Southwest (1,434,670 ha), we examined the relative influence of fine-scale topography and coarse-scale weather and climate on burn severity (the degree of change from before the fire to one year after) using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Together, topography, climate, and weather explained severe fire occurrence with classification accuracies ranging from 68% to 84%. Topographic variables were relatively more important predictors of severe fire occurrence than either climate or weather variables. Predictability of severe fire was consistently lower during years with widespread fires, suggesting that local control exerted by topography may be overwhelmed by regional climatic controls when fires burn in dry conditions. Annually, area burned severely was strongly correlated with area burned in all ecoregions (Pearson's correlation 0.86-0.97; p < 0.001), while the proportion of area burned severely was significantly correlated with area burned only in two ecoregions (p <= 0.037). During our short time series, only ecoregions in the Southwest showed evidence of a significant increase (p <= 0.036) in annual area burned and area burned severely, and annual proportion burned severely increased in just one of the three Southwest ecoregions. We suggest that predictive mapping of the potential for severe fire is possible, and will be improved with climate data at the scale of the topographic and Landsat-derived burn severity data. Although severity is a value-laden term implying negative ecosystem effects, we stress that severity can be objectively measured and recognize that high severity fire is an important ecological process within the historical range of variability in some ecosystems.","[Dillon, Gregory K.; Heyerdahl, Emily K.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Fire Sci Lab, Missoula, MT 59808 USA; [Holden, Zachary A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Missoula, MT 59807 USA; [Morgan, Penelope] Univ Idaho, Wildland Fire Program, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Morgan, Penelope] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Crimmins, Michael A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Luce, Charles H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Boise, ID 83702 USA",,"Dillon, GK (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Fire Sci Lab, Missoula, MT 59808 USA.",gdillon@fs.fed.us,,,,,,,103,288,358,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2011,2,12,,,,,,,130,10.1890/ES11-00271.1,0,,,,Ecology,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000208811300002,0,"both topography and climate affected forest and woodland burn severity in two regions of the western us, 1984 to 2006"

K-means clustering classifies wildfires into four types with distinct AHCs: low-PS-type and high-PS-type with lower and higher PS anomalies, respectively, LW-type featuring intense LW but weak SW anomalies, and wet-soil-type with wet soil anomalies. Each fire cluster represents 22%-27% of all the wildfires, featuring different combinations of climate and vegetation conditions and their diverse relations to regional hydrometeorological conditions, with wet-soil-type fires often exhibiting opposite correlations with AHCs compared to those of the other three types. In five major Koppen climate zones over the western U.S., clustering-based predictions improve the seasonal wildfire prediction accuracy (R-2) by 10% compared to prediction without classification. Such improvement comes from separating the opposite relationships between wet-soil-type fires and their seasonal AHCs from the other three types, along with separating LW-type fires, which include most of the lightning-ignited fires that occur more randomly. Increases in wildfire occurrence during 1984-2018 are dominated by the increases in the LW-type fires, while the wet-soil-type fires have decreased, consistent with the long-term drying in the western U.S.","[Chen, Xiaodong; Leung, L.

These parameters are widely used in empirical fire forecasting tools, thus confirming that an unguided, machine learning (ML) analysis can reproduce known relationships. The simple, short time scale parameters identified can therefore provide quantifiable forecast skill for wildfires with extreme sizes. In contrast, longer aggregates of weather observations for the year prior to fire start, including specific humidity, normalized precipitation indices, average temperature, average precipitation, and vegetation indices are not strongly coupled to extreme fire size, thus afford limited or no enhanced forecast skill. The TDA demonstrates that fuel moistures and short-term weather parameters should optimize the training of ML algorithms for fire forecasting, whilst longer-term climate and ecological measures could be downweighted or omitted. The most useful short-term meteorological and fuels metrics are widely available with low latency for the conterminous U.S, and are not computationally intensive to calculate, suggesting that ML tools using these data streams may suffice to improve situational awareness for wildfire hazards in the U.S.","[Bendick, Rebecca] Univ Montana, Dept Geosci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hoylman, Zachary H.] Univ Montana, Montana Climate Off, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",,"Hoylman, ZH (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Climate Off, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",zachary.hoylman@mso.umt.edu,,,,,,,33,5,6,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2020,15,10,,,,,,,104039,10.1088/1748-9326/aba8c2,0,,,,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000576429800001,0,topological data analysis reveals parameters with prognostic skill for extreme wildfire size

UAVs with remote-sensing capabilities are used with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep-learning algorithms to detect fire regions, make predictions, make decisions, and optimize fire-monitoring tasks. Moreover, UAVs equipped with various advanced sensors, including LIDAR, visual, infrared (IR), and monocular cameras, have been used to monitor bushfires due to their potential to provide new approaches and research opportunities.

In recent years, the problem of increased levels of volatile organic compounds in drinking water distribution systems after wildfires has gained attention as it poses a significant health threat to communities in those wildfire -prone areas. No adequate deterministic process models to predict the risk of high levels of volatile organic compounds in drinking water distribution systems after wildfires are available at this point, leaving data -driven machine learning approaches as solutions for addressing this problem. Here we build on a preceding study and enhance the assessment of maximum contamination exceedance probability predictions by applying deep convolutional neural networks trained with water samples from communities affected by wildfires in California and Oregon. We used satellite surface reflectance imagery in combination with gridded information of topography, fuel load, meteorology, and infrastructure as model inputs. The results show that the ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks increases the accuracy of predictions of postwildfire water contamination by 4.1% compared to preceding models based on Bayesian regularized shallow feedforward networks, reaching an overall accuracy of 92% for the test dataset.

To better understand how these factors contribute to large fire emissions (gridded monthly fire emissions >95th percentile of all the fire emissions in the western US; 0.009 Gg/month), we build a machine learning model to predict fire emissions (PM2.5) over the western US at 0.25 degrees resolution, interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). From the predictor contributions derived from XAI, we conduct k-means clustering analysis to identify four clusters of predictor variables representing different drivers of large fire emissions. The four clusters feature the contributions of fuel load (Cluster 1) and different levels of dryness (Cluster 2-4), controlled by fuel moisture, drought condition, and fire-favorable large-scale meteorological patterns featuring high temperature, high pressure, and low relative humidity. In the past two decades, large fire emissions peak in summer. However, large fire emissions increased significantly in September and October in 2010-2020 relative to 2000-2009, extending the peak large fire emissions from summer to autumn. The larger enhancements of large fire emissions during autumn compared to summer are contributed by decreased fuel moisture, along with more frequent concurrent fire-favorable large-scale meteorological patterns and drought. These results highlight fuel drying as a common driver supported by multiple drivers, such as warmer temperature and more frequent synoptic patterns favorable for fires, in increasing the autumn risk of large fire emissions across the western US. Plain Language Summary Global warming has been raising temperature and drying out the western US. The increasingly warmer climate influences the seasonal water cycle over the western US and changes wildfire activity and its seasonality. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a set of useful tools for interpreting the predictions made by the machine learning (ML) models. Leveraging the power of XAI and a statistical clustering method, we built a ML model to predict the fire emissions over the western US and grouped the grids with large fire emissions by which predictors have larger contributions to the large fire emissions. We identified four groups of large fire emissions controlled by abundant fuel and extreme, moderate, and weak drying conditions, respectively. The drying conditions are contributed by multiple factors, including drought, local dryness, and fire-favorable large-scale meteorological patterns (high temperature, high pressure, and low relative humidity). Additionally, the large fire emission peak of the first three groups extends from summer to autumn. The increased fire emissions in autumn are caused by warmer temperature, decreased fuel moisture, along with concurrent fire-favorable large-scale meteorology and drought. These findings underscore the importance of drying in increasing the autumn risk of large fire emissions across the western US.","[Wang, S. S. -C.; Leung, L.

In Zimbabwe, uncontrolled fires have been recurrent, yet a rigorous analysis of the key drivers is still lacking. Previous studies in Zimbabwe have predominantly focused on spatio-temporal dynamics of the occurrence of vegetation fire, leaving a gap in understanding the underlying drivers. Accurate prediction of fire occurrence and identification of the major drivers is imperative for effective fire management strategies. The study employs the Maxent model, a machine-learning approach, to analyze historical MODIS fire data alongside bioclimatic, topographic, anthropogenic, and vegetation variables, to assess the likelihood of fire occurrence in Zimbabwe. The research also aims to elucidate the major factors that influence fire occurrence within the region. The independent contributions of predictor variables to the model's goodness of fit are evaluated using a jackknife test, while model accuracy is assessed using the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Results indicate that elevation, precipitation seasonality, temperature annual range and human footprint emerge as the major factors influencing fire occurrence in Zimbabwe. The model demonstrates an acceptable accuracy, with an average AUC of 0.77. This study underscores the utility of the Maxent model in elucidating the contributions of various environmental factors to vegetation fire occurrence. Moreover, the ability of the model to predict the probability of fire occurrence offers valuable insights for fire managers, facilitating the assessment of the spatial vulnerability of vegetation to fire occurrence. Overall, this research contributes to an improved understanding of the drivers of vegetation fires in Zimbabwe and provides a practical tool for enhancing fire management efforts in the region and beyond.","[Mupfiga, Upenyu; Mutanga, Onisimo] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Discipline Geog, Private Bag X01, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Dube, Timothy] Univ Western Cape, Inst Water Studies, Dept Earth Sci, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa; [Mupfiga, Upenyu] Midlands State Univ, Dept Geog Environm Sustainabil & Resilience Bldg, Gweru 9055, Zimbabwe",,"Mupfiga, U (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Discipline Geog, Private Bag X01, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",218086584@stu.ukzn.ac.za,,,,,,,40,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2025,37,,,,,,,,101404,10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101404,0,,nov-24,,Environmental Sciences; Remote Sensing,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001395559000001,0,assessing drivers of vegetation fire occurrence in zimbabwe - insights from maxent modelling and historical data analysis

Traditional methods for detecting AFs rely on the statistical analysis of AF radiance and background features. However, these algorithms are resource-intensive to develop and exhibit limited adaptability, particularly in distinguishing AF from interference pixels. Deep learning (DL) technologies, which can extract deep features from images, offer a new solution for efficiently detecting AF. This article proposes an AF detection model based on convolutional neural networks, named DAFDM. By integrating multilayer features through an enhanced feature processing module, the model produces high-quality AF information, accurately detecting AF from the background. Given the presence of uncorrected false alarms in the training labels, it is challenging for DL models to distinguish interference pixels, we construct a Landsat-8 dataset encompassing various fire types and interference objects, with precise labels. Comparing several architectures, we find that only U-Net type models can discern the AF boundary pixels fully and accurately. The proposed method outperforms other AF detection algorithms, achieving IoU and F1-score of 87.28% and 93.21%, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that DAFDM possesses robust generalization capability in distinguishing interference pixels. The incorporation of land surface temperature as auxiliary data further improves DAFDM's performance, with interpretability methods employed to elucidate the impact of input data on predictions. This method is anticipated to further contribute to AF monitoring and wildfire development pattern analysis.","[Gao, Xu] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Environm & Spatial Informat, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wenzhong; Zhang, Min] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Technol & Innovat Res Inst Futian, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lukang] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China",,"Shi, WZ; Zhang, M (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Technol & Innovat Res Inst Futian, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China.",xugao@cumt.edu.cn; john.wz.shi@polyu.edu.hk; lsgi-min.zhang@polyu.edu.hk; wanglukang@sdust.edu.cn,,,,,,,57,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,18,,,,,,7982,8000,,10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3545114,0,,,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,Engineering; Physical Geography; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:001453608400011,0,dafdm: a discerning deep learning model for active fire detection based on landsat-8 imagery

Here we develop a novel object-based system for tracking the progression of individual fires using 375 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fire detections. At each half-daily time step, fire pixels are clustered according to their spatial proximity, and are either appended to an existing active fire object or are assigned to a new object. This automatic system allows us to update the attributes of each fire event, delineate the fire perimeter, and identify the active fire front shortly after satellite data acquisition. Using this system, we mapped the history of California fires during 2012-2020. Our approach and data stream may be useful for calibration and evaluation of fire spread models, estimation of near-real-time wildfire emissions, and as means for prescribing initial conditions in fire forecast models.

With more large fires resulting in more emissions of fine particulate matter, an accurate prediction of fire emissions is critical for quantifying the impacts of fires on air quality, human health, and climate. This study aims to construct a machine learning (ML) model with game-theory interpretation to predict monthly fire emissions over the contiguous US (CONUS) and to understand the controlling factors of fire emissions. The optimized ML model is used to diagnose the process-based models in the Fire Modeling Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) to inform future development. Results show promising performance for the ML model, Community Land Model (CLM), and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator-Interactive Fire And Emission Algorithm For Natural Environments (JULES-INFERNO) in reproducing the spatial distributions, seasonality, and interannual variability of fire emissions over the CONUS. Regional analysis shows that only the ML model and CLM simulate the realistic interannual variability of fire emissions for most of the subregions (r > 0.95 for ML and r = 0.14 similar to 0.70 for CLM), except for Mediterranean California, where all the models perform poorly (r = 0.74 for ML and r < 0.30 for the FireMIP models). Regarding seasonality, most models capture the peak emission in July over the western US. However, all models except for the ML model fail to reproduce the bimodal peaks in July and October over Mediterranean California, which may be explained by the smaller wind speeds of the atmospheric forcing data during Santa Ana wind events and limitations in model parameterizations for capturing the effects of Santa Ana winds on fire activity. Furthermore, most models struggle to capture the spring peak in emissions in the southeastern US, probably due to underrepresentation of human effects and the influences of winter dryness on fires in the models. As for extreme events, both the ML model and CLM successfully reproduce the frequency map of extreme emission occurrence but overestimate the number of months with extremely large fire emissions. Comparing the fire PM2.5 emissions from the ML model with process-based fire models highlights their strengths and uncertainties for regional analysis and prediction and provides useful insights into future directions for model improvements.","[Wang, Sally S-C; Qian, Yun; Leung, L.

Annual variation in the abundance and distribution of fine-fuel present challenges to land managers implementing prescribed burns and mitigating wildfire, although methods to produce high-resolution fuel estimates are still under development. To further understand how prescribed fire and wildfire influence fine-fuels in a semi-arid grassland invaded by non-native perennial grasses, we combined high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery with in situ vegetation data and machine learning to estimate yearly fine-fuel loads from 2015 to 2020. The resulting model of fine-fuel corresponded to field-based validation measurements taken in the first (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 218 kg/ha) and last year (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 196 kg/ha) of this 6-year study. Serial prediction of the fine-fuel model allowed for an assessment of the effect of prescribed fire (average reduction of -80 kg/ha 1-year post fire) and wildfire (-260 kg/ha 1-year post fire) on fuel conditions. Post-fire fine-fuel loads were significantly lower than in unburned control areas sampled just outside fire perimeters from 2015 to 2020 across all fires (t = 1.67, p < 0.0001); however, fine-fuel recovery occurred within 3-5 years, depending upon burn and climate conditions. When coupled with detailed fuels data from field measurements, Sentinel-2A imagery provided a means for evaluating grassland fine-fuels at yearly time steps and shows high potential for extended monitoring of dryland fuels. Our approach provides land managers with a systematic analysis of the effects of fire management treatments on fine-fuel conditions and provides an accurate, updateable, and expandable solution for mapping fine-fuels over yearly time steps across drylands throughout the world.","[Wells, Adam G.; Munson, Seth M.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Sesnie, Steven E.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Southwest Reg, Albuquerque, NM 87103 USA; [Villarreal, Miguel L.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA",,"Wells, AG (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.",agwells@usgs.gov; smunson@usgs.gov; steven_sesnie@fws.gov; mvillarreal@usgs.gov,,,,,,,70,10,11,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,4,4,,,,,,,84,10.3390/fire4040084,0,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000738902300001,0,remotely sensed fine-fuel changes from wildfire and prescribed fire in a semi-arid grassland

Particulate matter delays the GNSS signal, which affects the like precipitable water vapor (LPWV) derived by the GNSS non-hydrostatic delay. Most of the information of GNSS-derived LPWV is caused by water vapor, and a small part of the information is caused by particulate matter. A new method based on the difference (Delta PWV) between the PWV of virtual radiosonde stations network and GNSS-derived LPWV is proposed to detect the changes of particulate matter in the atmosphere during the 2020 California wildfires. There are few radiosonde stations in the experimental area and they are far away from the GNSS station. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network method to establish the virtual radiosonde network in the experimental area. The PWV derived by the fifth-generation European center for medium-range weather forecasts reanalysis model (PWVERA5) is used as the input data of machine learning. The PWV derived by radiosonde data (PWVRAD) is used as the training target data of machine learning. The Delta PWV is obtained based on PWV derived by the virtual radiosonde station network and GNSS in the experimental area. In order to further reduce the influence of noise and other factors on Delta PWV, this paper attempts to decompose Delta PWV time series by using the singular spectrum analysis method, and obtain its principal components, subsequently, analyzing the relationship between the principal components of Delta PWV with particulate matter. The results indicate that the accuracy of PWV predicted by the virtual radiosonde network is significantly better than the fifth-generation European center for the medium-range weather forecast reanalysis model, and the change trend of Delta PWV is basically consistent with the change law of particulate matter in which the value of Delta PWV in the case of fire is significantly higher than that before and after the fire. The mean of correlation coefficients between Delta PWV and PM10 at each GNSS station before, during and after wildfires are 0.068, 0.397 and 0.065, respectively, which show the evident enhancement of the correlation between Delta PWV and particulate matter during wildfires. It is concluded that because of the high sensitiveness of Delta PWV to the change of particulate matter, the GNSS technique can be used as an effective new approach to detect the change of particulate matter and, then, to detect wildfires effectively.","[Guo, Jinyun; Hou, Rui; Zhou, Maosheng; Jin, Xin] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Li, Guowei] Shandong Prov Inst Land Surveying & Mapping, Dept Space & Technol, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",,"Zhou, MS (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China.",guojy@sdust.edu.cn; hourui@sdust.edu.cn; zhoumaosheng2018@sdust.edu.cn; skdjinxin1010@sdust.edu.cn; ligw@shandong.cn,,,,,,,45,5,6,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,13,22,,,,,,,4557,10.3390/rs13224557,0,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,08/04/2025,WOS:000771958500011,0,detection of particulate matter changes caused by 2020 californiawildfires based on gnss and radiosonde station
